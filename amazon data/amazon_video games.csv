The lighting, renders, tattoos, hairstyles, neighborhood and MyCareer cutscenes are delivered with more quality and style than previous versions.

Why bother, as soon as you put in game it forces you (yes exits game if don't have update) to download 30+GB update, so Nintendo's server took 3hr to get that. [Never mind the force you to have a SD card as well, even thou you bought the cartridge version]. So 3hr later game finally starts, oh wait, another forced in game update [pro 2K servers] that took another hour or so. Honestly! Why bother with a cartridge version then, if you must get a SD Card for it, and then wait 4hr to download the game anyway. How do you think a 9yr old kid enjoys the wait???????? Good job 2K. On top of that Switch version runs so bad, low frame rate, choppy video, and slow in game load times. And lets not forget that somehow 2K found a way to add a card-collecting game in there with micro-transaction. Worst Switch game ever, 2K should be ashamed of the lazy programing as they did not want to bother making a game that loads data from cartridge when needed, and then found a way to try to milk more money from an all-ready bad game with micro-transaction for a basketball game. Avoid this game at all cost, and maybe even consider avoiding 2K games as well.</span>","Be ready to wait, and wait, and wait.

I play mostly single-player offline. There are several issues with this game, but the motion detection and the God-mode computer AI is the most obvious. Many times while playing defense I get in perfect position, only to have the ball morph through the hands and body of my defensive player and appear in the computer players hands for an easy layup. Double-teaming in the post against the computer is impossible. The computer has magnets in their hands while playing defense and some passes on offense are a gamble regardless of how well you position the receiving player to receive it. The computer, no matter how well you make defensive adjustments, go on God-like runs where they steal simple passes and you miss layups regardless of the offense player's rating. The computer AI forces some games to become competitive and it takes away from the realism. Still can't use alternate uniforms even though they added a 4th uniform option.<br><br>Also, its kinda strange how Amazon changes prices. I originally ordered this for around $45. Had a payment error, re-ordered and the price 'conveniently' increased $5 bucks overnight. Reordered and checked site a few days later and noticed price-drop of $10.......all in a matter of days.

No effort was made to make this game more portable.  Additionally I do not see much improvement over 2K19 and for whatever reason they decided NOT to include a KD era Warriors in their historical team roster, you know the most winningest team since the MJ Bulls.<br><br>MyCareer, for example, is a single player mode that can ONLY be played while online.  If you take a pause mid-game the Switch will go into sleep mode and you lose your connection and game session.  When I first started this mode downloading my face scan took so long that I had to keep touching my Switch to prevent it from going into sleep mode and starting over.<br><br>Compare this to Blizzard’s Diablo 3 port.  D3 was previously exclusively only an online game, but when brought to the Switch they took the time to ensure the game was portable and could handle not being connected 24/7.<br><br>When I first got this title I had to restart the initial update patch several times due to the game not being able to handle losing connectivity while in sleep mode.  Unfortunately the interface did not indicate it was resuming where it left off so it was unclear to me if I needed to literally sit there and watch my Switch and move it to prevent sleep mode.<br><br>I like NBA 2K.  Last year I got NBA 2K19 on the Switch after having owned and played it on the Xbox.  However this year I went exclusively with the Switch and the glaring omissions and lazy approach to this port really highlight this versions’s short comings.</span>",NBA 2K20 Lazy port for the Switch,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG5DZHDZ65ANZKNRM2A3EUKOJWQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It's incomplete, looks cheap, and has a few new bells and whistles.<br><br>let's start with the good- the music and the NBA Combine and Skills Test, and the WNBA plays nice. The MyPlayer looks pretty much the same and while I like all the options to make him an elite player, he still misses wide open 3s and easy layups.<br><br>The bad is everything else that I play, namely My career mode. The storyline is a complete yawn. I literally fell asleep. It's too somber and serious for a game and unrealistic. The gameplay feels like something is missing, especially when dribbling. MyPlayer looks pasted in scenes so his hair looks phony. I have VC coins that came with the game but I can only buy Gatorade and not upgrade my player. The background in the settings look cheesey. The scenes break oddly, as if there was supposed to be another scene afterward with the anticipation of something happening, but it never does. The worse part is the game uploads extremely SLOW, even between transition of one selection to the next. I literally went to bed. The next day, same slowness. I made a sandwich, came back, and the game still hadn't uploaded.<br><br>The worse of all, is MyPlayer has NO NAME. No name on jersey or stats. It's awful!<br><br>All I can say is, don't delete 2K19. Wait until 2K does a major patch update for this game or skip it for this year.</span>",Warning!

If I could right now I would ask for my money back until it works correctly.  If you read below you will see that MyTeam and it’s ridiculous amount of microtransactions was already a mode I decreasingly enjoyed.  I had some<br>Issues but a lot of friends were complaining to me that I would not believe this years problems so<br>I checked it out more.  There are some graphical<br>Issues with pop in and clipping and getting stuck on a backboard(yes that really happened) but somehow the microtransactions are worse because the virtual currency you buy is not even working.  If you spend it to increase attributes it appears to do absolutely nothing and some people have said their attributes actually decreased.  Your VC surely goes down so you literally just spent your money on nothing.  Please Wait until everything is fixed and it goes on sale later this year and enjoy all the other great games that just came out like Gears 5, Borderlands 3 and Astral Chain.<br><br>The NBA 2K series is a purchase every year for me and this year was no different however the continued increase of reliance on virtual currency through micro transactions still remains a massive disappointment.  Every year it feels like the grind to do missions and complete tasks to earn currency for more player packs to open is more daunting.  I know a lot of people spend money to buy packs but I just can’t get over how necessary it now seems to spend your own money.  As a result the My Team mode for me becomes something I enjoy less and less each year.  One great addition this year is an engaging and fun story line in the story mode with some actual A list acting talent.  The story definitely has its tropes and some stiff acting moments but I actually find these story modes to be a nice break and change up from my constant full season grind.  Luckily one thing the series continues to nail is the NBA gameplay so playing a season continues to remain a joy.  The graphics look great but there are definitely still some players who seem to look pretty different from their real life counterparts.  The switch version looks better than last year in my opinion but I still love it for my nba 2K fix while traveling despite the difference with the lower frame rate on the switch edition.  Unfortunately there is still a massive download for the switch version because they use a smaller cartridge which always feels like a penalty for those of us who prefer a physical copy<br>The game as always though runs smooth although I have to admit it will take me some time to avoid using the sprint button as frequently since they throttled it this year causing players to get tired very quickly.  It slows the game up some but it’s not as unfair as you might think.  Overall it’s a good game and what you would expect, the best NBA game on the market with far too many micro transactions.<br><br>Honestly in my opinion if you get it every year and enjoy it buy it.  But if you can wait because of the length of an NBA season I say wait for sales which may happen quickly and if not there will be a large price cut around Black Friday sale time in November.</span>",Updated!!!

If I could right now I would ask for my money back until it works correctly.  If you read below you will see that MyTeam and it’s ridiculous amount of microtransactions was already a mode I decreasingly enjoyed.  I had some<br>Issues but a lot of friends were complaining to me that I would not believe this years problems so<br>I checked it out more.  There are some graphical<br>Issues with pop in and clipping and getting stuck on a backboard(yes that really happened) but somehow the microtransactions are worse because the virtual currency you buy is not even working.  If you spend it to increase attributes it appears to do absolutely nothing and some people have said their attributes actually decreased.  Your VC surely goes down so you literally just spent your money on nothing.  Please Wait until everything is fixed and it goes on sale later this year and enjoy all the other great games that just came out like Gears 5, Borderlands 3 and Astral Chain.<br><br>  The NBA 2K series is a purchase every year for me and this year was no different however the continued increase of reliance on virtual currency through micro transactions still remains a massive disappointment.  Every year it feels like the grind to do missions and complete tasks to earn currency for more player packs to open is more daunting.  I know a lot of people spend money to buy packs but I just can’t get over how necessary it now seems to spend your own money.  As a result the My Team mode for me becomes something I enjoy less and less each year.  One great addition this year is an engaging and fun story line in the story mode with some actual A list acting talent.  The story definitely has its tropes and some stiff acting moments but I actually find these story modes to be a nice break and change up from my constant full season grind.  Luckily one thing the series continues to nail is the NBA gameplay so playing a season continues to remain a joy.  The graphics look great but there are definitely still some players who seem to look pretty different from their real life counterparts.  The game as always though runs smooth although I have to admit it will take me some time to avoid using the sprint button as frequently since they throttled it this year causing players to get tired very quickly.  It slows the game up some but it’s not as unfair as you might think.  Overall it’s a good game and what you would expect, the best NBA game on the market with too many micro transactions.<br><br>Honestly in my opinion if you get it every year and enjoy it buy it.  But if you can wait because of the length of an NBA season I say wait for sales which may happen quickly and if not there will be a large price cut around Black Friday sale time in November.</span>",Updated!!

If people have to complain about that then maybe they should grind in the game and not complain when they can earn VC tokens like how most games should be played and by grinding and not having to buy coins.

Over the years Visual Concepts has had the best sports game on the market. But recently they have become lazy barely improving their game. As one of the best selling games, it is actually surprising how they keep getting away with putting the same game on the market every year.<br> Gameplay has been a major advantage for 2k sports. It is seriously the best gameplay you can get on any sports game on the market. But when I first played NBA 2k20, I noticed something that has seemed very similar to the previous three games. It seemed like I was in a trance. I quickly went back to 2k18 and 2k19 and it was the same.<br>Every year it's the same animations and it gets boring. The 2k team has not removed any of the animations that the gaming community constantly complains about. Driving baseline, shooting a layup and not being able to pull out of it, hip steals, and finally microtransactions. Even when I use the best ball handler in the NBA, Kyrie Irving who has a 96 ball handle, I still find myself losing the ball to scrub defenders. I myself have fallen victim to microtransactions. It always looks like a good deal until after it’s purchased. In the long, run you always spend more on them then the actual game does ($60.00). This has been a problem ever since the introduction of MyTeam in 2k13. Just when you think it would improve, it doesn’t.<br> I will give credit to 2k where they deserve. They offer a variety of game modes. But the one thing that has remained in these modes. The commentators. It has been the same voices since the TNT crew was added to the game. Lately, they have added other voices as special guests but there still has not been an overhaul of the commentators. When the new season comes around, a lot of the talk between them stays the same. They add simple lines to talk about the new players. Which really just shows me that the game is very repetitive.<br> Even with the poor gameplay improvements over the last few years, 2k remains one of the best selling games. IGN’s review said it best, a lot of these modes are too dependent on microtransactions. Sound familiar? If you love the sport of basketball and are a die-hard basketball fan then it’s very simple. This is the game for you. However, if your only a casual fan or vaguely intrigued then steer away from this product.  If you still need some basketball gameplay in your life you can turn to NBA 2k Playgrounds, NBA Jam, or NBA Live. They may not be quite as exciting but they aren’t nearly expensive.</span>",NBA 2k20: A Whole Lot of the Same,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIIWLXBNHM6DIEN6LCSSZCIFY4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

In general, the gameplay is absolute trash. My player won't accelerate quickly, if at all, when he gets the ball, in any mode, which sucks because it's nearly impossible to score fastbreak points. It doesn't even matter how fast or how much faster my player is, he runs too slowly that even opponent's big men can catch up.<br><br>The movement has gotten even clunkier, it looks like they're trying to make it harder for players to move or do much. Heck, even when I'm defending, my player moves slower than the opponent ball handler, who shouldn't be able to outrun my player on sprint. This makes absolutely no sense! This game makes it clear that they're biased towards opponent AI, as if previous games didn't make that clear.<br><br>Teammate AI is also probably at its worst. Where's the defense from my teammates? All they do is keep their hands when defending under the basket, but opponent AI will block me or do whatever they can to prevent me from scoring. 2K really needs to hire people who actually watches NBA to work on this game, because it's clear the current employees have no idea what they're doing. I would not recommend this game, it's probably the worst of the series, and that's saying a lot.<br><br>Update: After weeks of playing MyTeam, I can confirm that the gameplay for the mode is even worse. For some reason, your players are more likely to miss somewhat contested layups and shots while your opponents are very likely to make heavily contested layups. Whoever made this game definitely did not want to give us a basketball game. Not only that, but players like Kobe move too slowly, and in general the players start moving slowly for two seconds or so before moving faster, which makes fast break more impossible. The people who worked on this game definitely don't watch sports to keep screwing up this game year after year.<br><br>Also, I don't believe this game getting 4 stars, they must have used bots or some means of getting high ratings because 2K20 is a three-star game, at most.</span>","AVOID BUYING, SAVE YOUR MONEY!

It was our father \ son time together and our passion<br><br>How times change.  I'm frankly amazed at the ratings on Amazon as the Metacritic rating (average across all gaming sites is only 78%) and review on Reddit and other sites are appaling.  This game is so fundamentally broken on so many levels that frankly it takes much out of the game.<br><br>for example: -<br><br>1.  In Mycareer the AI of the fellow players can be horrible in terms of defense.  Players don't switch.  Shooters get left widen open even when play 3-2 zone<br><br>2.  Shooting whether youre using the stick or X button feels off and random. You can have over 80% 3 point shooting and still often miss wide open three's.<br><br>3.  Coaches AI will call time outs literally 1-2 minutes after I've called one wasting valuable time outs for no reason<br><br>4.  Coach AI won't respect minute allocation or coverage allocation in Mycareer.

My favorite aspect of NBA 2K series is the online head to head play. Literally buy the game every year to do that, MyGM, and maybe a little MyTeam and MyCareer here and there but multiplayer is my forte. I just love versing other people online. Only issue is... it is nearly unplayable. You will find yourself pulling your hairs out wondering why you can't hit a jump shot that's literally 10 feet from the basket or why they decided to do a last minute reverse layup and hit under the hoop and out of bounds. It literally has an input lag and I feel in past games there was this issue but more frequently in recent years and this game is easily one of the worst. It's to the point where I strategize playing but driving to the basket because the shooting is so awful and delayed. Also the fact that you can verse the same exact time is by far the most annoying thing and there is no option to friendly concede. You will also notice the frame lagging.<br><br>The graphics for this game are great, some character models extensively detailed more than others. The commentary has added commentators to the roster but they are still repeating lines from like 2k14 and with playing a team more than 2 times you'll already start to notice.<br><br>TakeTwo has plenty of money to be able to fix these server issues and improve the gameplay. There needs to be a stress on adding more to the game with better live updates within the real NBA. As a fan for many years if I am to buy a future game I will be purchasing it used to not directly give the company money. I think it's time we take a step back from consistently giving them money year after year and force them to invest that money into fixing simple day to day errors within the game.</span>",Online Multiplayer is Basically Unplayable,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGIXS3KK5LYOXP5XMKUQB6GSMYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Badge grinding is also made easier as there are many after game practices each targeting a specific category of badge (finishing, shooting, playmaking, defense).  Also, the badge system and new build system allow for a ton of new and different builds, unlike in the past, where you were either a slasher, shooter, or defender.<br><br>Now the bad and there's aplenty.  The new badge system really messes up competition in mypark.  The flexibility is good in a way but also bad.  You can have centers with Gold dimer badges or finishers with shooting badges.  It is incredibly confusing.  You have no idea how to guard your guy until his ""slasher"" nails a half court 3 and you realize he has 5 gold shooting badges.  What's more, almost everyone has interception and pickpocket badges which completely nerfs my archetype pass-first playmaker.  Passing is completely destroyed in park with tons of interceptions.  The game has removed almost every single advantage for a high-iq player.  For instance you can pump fake someone into the air but your gather is so slow, he'll be able to block you on his second jump.  Ditto with my hesitations to mistime the defender.  He'll bite and jump as you near the rim but it won't matter cause you cannot get your shot off before he's ready to jump again or his mere presence makes you miss the wide open layup.  You can't backdoor cut anymore as they've moved the inbounds to half court.  Everyone is now practically 99 speed with gatorade exercise boosts.  As someone who relies completely on IQ and reading the defender and who stinks at spamming crossovers and step backs and shooting, I am completely useless in park.  The game is so sluggish compared to 2k18.  (I had a 0.780 win record in 2k18 park across 5000 games.)<br><br>Other complaints: 1) the park courts are hideous and hard to navigate 2) you cannot join other friend's games unless they invite you. 3) it is really difficult to know who is a good player or bad (need to click 8 buttons to get to their park record) 4) there seems to be a lot of players with ""glitched"" players.  Whereas I only have one category of stats in the 90's, I see guys with 90 finishing, 86 shooting, and 99 playmaking.  There's no way you can create this type of player with the build system unless they exploited an early glitch. 5) parks are too spread out with too few players active 6) there is no fair matchmaking system.  99 dudes with .900 records team up with other 99 dudes with .850 records and destroy random teams.  This is the norm.<br><br>All in all, multiplayer is complete garbage this year.</span>",Park is utterly destroyed.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFE5I6E22C45HB4W3C7ITSUIDO7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

First impression, the animations and graphics seemed to have regressed from 2K17. The player motions are off and 2K seemingly has adopted the NBA Live controls and shot meter.

The players run like they are physically disabled, especially when they begin jogging. The acceleration is poor and unrealistic and immensely frustrating. The physics are off and not realistic especially with the passing. Fast breaks are nonexistent I expect players to perform as they do in real life, but they simply don't. Klay is not automatic from catch and shoot 3's. Steph isn't 50% from 30 ft out. 3's in transition have a 0% chance of going in unless you slow down the play completely and wait for the D to return. Anthony Davis can't dunk over another player. Passing is incredibly slow. Players on your team foul the guy driving to the rim even if you're not controlling them. It does not feel like basketball and a single regularly moving player would destroy everyone.

As much as I am not a fan of MLB The Show as of recent releases (19 &amp; 20) I wish sports games would take note of MLB The Show's Community Market. MLB The Show does a fantastic job auctioning off cards in their Community Market. You constantly lose MT renewing contracts in the game in the My Team mode.

Once I bought and played it... I honestly understand why it got Game Of The Year because it is such an emotional yet wonderful experience. I found myself going back into the world even after completing everything because I love the detail and graphics that instantly transported me into Kratos' world. Another point that I want to make is that it was pretty hard for me to get into it because the dynamic between Kratos and Atreus felt harsh and empty, I felt no connection to the characters nor did I feel like rooting for them. I'm glad that I pushed on because it opens up much more that makes me see it differently and appreciate the dynamic even more by the end. If you decide to play it and feel like I did, for sure you should play till the end as it gets so much better.</span>",Such an amazing game.

Definitely one of the best PS4 exclusives without a doubt.</span>",Truly amazing game!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH4SLZAYZXAQUVHIRNLNDMCTBDYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

They all are decent games, but GOW4 is absolute masterpiece. Story is exceptionally well written, voice acting is amazing; movement choreography, graphics, sounds is best I have ever seen in any computer game. it is not just the best GOW game - it is truly the best game you can play on PS4. Considering that this game is PS4 exclusive - I would actually consider buying PS4 just to experiance this game. The game is unmistakably GOW, but adds exploration dynamics - quests and things to do after finishing the game. All previous GOW games were linear - go from one room to another to fight monsters and solve puzzles. This game allows you to explore at your own pace. Puzzles are somewhat easier compared to previous games. But fighting challenges can be very difficult, more so than in previous games. Auto save works very well, and you don't have to start the long boss fight from the very beginning if you miss one critical blow (a common frustration in previous games of this series).</span>",Best game in GOW series: True Masterpiece,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH67NXFABC2DJVZNUID5OO7NJTQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This is a five star game. Quite frankly, it's beautiful.<br>You may have noticed some poor reviews. Allow me to explain. God of War has developed a fan base over the last decade. Ever since God of War released on the ps2. It was a game that forever changed the landscape because it was so breathtaking and also so ruthless. Yes, there was tons of action but over the next few years, with the release of the brilliant God of War 2 and eventually on the PS3, God of War 3, the series had become known for its uncompromising protagonist and it's brilliant and bloody gore. If you haven't played those games yet then go do it, but suffice it to say that you probably don't quite understand how gory some moments in those games are. Now, with the release of God of War on the ps4, we have a different Kratos and a different flighting system. There's some blood in this game but not nearly as much as the fans expect. Gone is the brutality and gore and in it's place we have bigger themes and bigger landscapes and broader characters. Which is awesome. But, man, Santa Monica studios, some of us out there are itching for more of the same and miss the insane Kratos chopping creatures up and down with his blades of choas, while we mindlessly and ruthlessly button mash the square button and roll away with the right stick and then button mash the circle button until Kratos pulls something's head off while it's still breathing and it's heart is still beating.<br>That being said, this is the best game on the ps4. And if I had to choose one game to play on the PS4, it would be this one. Hands down</span>",Beautiful and grounded.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKSPUEWKZ6OG6SG75OAYKCHEZPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ohhhh!! Ahh! Ehhh!? GASP!!”.<br>It spells everything out multiple times, like a kids TV show, all the time, the situations, the surroundings, just in case you’re blind or can’t keep up with the simplistic and predictable story:<br>“Eh!

Royal gave me maybe an extra 20-30 extra hours of gameplay, but when the vanilla version gave me 80 hours then that is a huge price point difference when it comes to time played. If you have not played the vanilla version then this is the one to get because Atlus removed some annoying mechanics from the original version and goes without saying all the additional content.

You'll remember this for a long time.<br><br>There's just a list of minor annoyances that exist:<br>-The 'realistic audio' is cool and all, meaning voices are muffled if you aren't within a decent line of sight from a character, but this means you'll be plowing ahead of Ellie and she'll be talking behind a rock, and you won't understand a word she's saying. This requires subtitles. Subtitles ruin the experience for me because I read far faster than most games talk. You could also walk really slowly to stay next to Ellie at all times. But who wants to do that?<br>-The combat is the usual Naughty Dog style where it varies from extremely trivial to incredibly hard, and in some cases a fight that was hard for you on the first playthrough is easy on the second time, and the other way around<br>-Speaking of the combat, you can skip past most of the encounters by sneaking<br>-...until the game suddenly decides sneaking doesn't work and you have to fight 8 enemies at once<br>-So many enemies 1 hit KO you on any difficulty<br>-The hardest difficulty isn't very hard when you realize the game will always provide you with resources when you run low<br>-Why is Summer longer than Fall/Winter combined?<br>-The Playstation trophies are garbage<br><br>I've told many people I truly think this game is best experienced on the easiest difficulty and pretend it's a very long interactive book, and they've largely agreed. There isn't quite an experience like this game that I can think of, maybe God of War gets close but for slightly different reasons, so it's impossible to say this game isn't great and near a masterpiece.

I just purchased this game for $17.99 on Jun 6 and the price has already dropped to $12.59, talk about dirty. Also, the game case was cracked in the corner and the case won't completely close! Amazon should really ship games better!!<br>The biggest disappointment with this remaster is the graphics! There is absolutely no reason graphics of this caliber couldn't run at full 4K. This game is locked at 1800p and it looks so bad on my $2000+ 4K monitor. the graphics aren't sharp at all and there is lots of aliasing. This is a PS3 game, there is nothing spectacular and demanding about the graphics for the PS4 PRO not being able to run it at 4K. The textures aren't even higher resolution, it looks so PS3 like. The developers could have at least added higher resolution textures but they were lazy to do so. Just like they were too lazy to convert the game from its complex PS3 code to the PS4. As I said, this is a PS3 game and the graphics really show it. There is absolutely no reason for the PS4 PRO not being able to run this game at 4K other than the improper code conversion from the PS3 to PS4 as a result of laziness from the developers.  Lastly, one would expect a remaster to include every single game item and DLC for free, but instead, this game is still loaded with transactions on the PSN store such as weapons for single player and multiplayer.

Nonsensical storyline, very easy to die in (I died in the prologue for christ's sake), too easy to get lost in (and not in a good way) and these are the complaints I have off the top of my head. The worst part about this is that I was dying on the easiest difficulty setting (believe it or don't; not caring).  The game did arrive in really good shape, which is the only thing that redeems the game for me.  That redeeming quality is within Amazon and not the game itself, so that point's rendered moot.  The only reason this game gets 1 star is because it's the lowest one could give piece of garage products like this game.  I'd personally and gladly give it 0 stars if I could (or even negative stars because I dislike the game that much).<br><br>1st time reviewing products on Amazon and on mobile, so I'm sorry for any and all spelling, pronunciation and/or format errors.</span>",How is this game considered to be a masterpiece?,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLAMWOMPAWMSOL2EAHQQV4R7S5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Gameplay is challenging enough but slow at times. The zombies/monsters are pretty cool. Some are hard to figure out how to destroy (but that's part of the fun). Character acting is not nearly as bad as many games. If you're looking for a storyline-based game that you can play in your leisure time and you like zombies, this is worth a look.</span>",Excellent,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEKQAJZOZIKRL7CW6RFJGRUPNJPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

As I've gotten older though, I've found that giving games a try is better than writing them off because they might be scary.

The pure heartwrenching moment of Sarah's death at the beginning and how that changed Joel's character really showed what loss can do to a person. I also really enjoyed how Ellie and Joel's relationship developed throughout the game - how they grew to care and trust one another. And that ending - brilliant. This game makes you second guess how you'd react in the same situation and really think about humanity as a whole.<br><br>Am I good a shooter games?

As someone who has played every mainline entry since the original Pokemon Red and Blue, I am particularly disappointed to see the quality of Pokemon games declining for the past few years. First, over 60% of all Pokemon have been cut and do not appear in any playable form in this game. All previous starters except the Charizard line and all previous legendaries, for example, have been removed by Game Freak. I have been training my Blastoise since Pokemon FireRed and transferring him to each new generation. I never thought I would see the day I could not play with Blastoise in a mainline Pokemon game. Game Freak's excuses are also unforgivable. The Pokemon models and animations are the same as those since Pokemon X and Y. The Nintendo 64 game Pokemon Stadium has superior, livelier animations than this Switch game. And they are charging $20 dollars for less Pokemon, costly Internet, and recycled models.<br><br>Look, instead, go buy Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Dragon Quest XI or The Witcher 3. These masterpieces offer a superior story, engaging battle mechanics, and modern visuals. It's a shame that Pokemon has fallen. Super Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild set the benchmark of what a Nintendo franchise can offer on the Switch. However, Pokemon Sword and Switch have set a new low for the series. To buy this game is to perpetuate low standards in a multimillion franchise and corporate greed from Game Freak's part. Save Pokemon and boycott Sword and Shield!</span>",DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFQOOED5SJDI5QGGPIBRBYQMS6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It is the worst Pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard Pokémon formula. Being understaffed isn't even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games; GameFreak has serious leadership issues.<br><br>This trash heap is the result of complacency, and a lack of effort and dedication.

Nintendo should be ashamed to be associated with this garbage. A very short list of issues:<br>- Graphics are OBJECTIVELY worse than Let's Go Pikachu and I would argue they're worse than Pokemon USUM. This terrible excuse for graphics is why we lost over half of all Pokemon in the game? What a load of garbage.<br>- We lost over half of all Pokemon in the game. Not just uncatchable, but they're not even in the game, you can't transfer into the games because they excluded excluded metadata for them and decided to exclude EXISTING Pokemon models from the game, which is what they did for other Pokemon.<br>- Only 80 new Pokemon overall. They didn't even try.<br>- Their new Pokemon battle concept is essentially: ""Look, the Pokemon is now bigger! See how big it is? Pretty cool, huh?"" No creativity, it sounds like a throwaway idea someone said jokingly during a meeting that they took as a serious comment and went with it. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.<br>- You'd think that Pokemon becoming bigger versions of themselves would mean Pokemon size would be an important thing to scale. Nope. They have Wailord shown as being slightly smaller as the 4'10"" trainer (~150 cm). Wailord is supposed to be a 50 ft (~15m) long behemoth. But nope, huge (literally) details are no longer important.<br>- Finally, the straw that broker the camel's back: the game froze when I was battling in the Ice-gym. I had auto-save on, but also kept manually saving anyway because I couldn't trust anything in the game at that point. When I restarted the game after it froze, the save point there was in Route 6, basically half the game ago.<br><br>At that point I juts gave up on the game. I lost half the progress because this terrible-developed game couldn't bother to QA their garbage product. I'm going to try to return the game, but doubt I'll be able to.  This left a bad taste in my mouth and I may never buy another Pokemon game again unless management changes and they start making respectable games again.</span>","Worst game by top developer in the past decade - unfinished, buggy, disappointing",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEWJ66ZH3CCLIIRS44KLB5CG7SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Got it as a time waster, but the selection of pokemon is poor and small compared to other games. Never been into pokemon, and I think I picked the low point of the series to jump in. The animations for the mons are laughably lazy and consist primarily of static translation or rotation, no moving limbs or anything, though it appears this may get better with more advanced pokemon. Its incredibly disappointing to be able to weaken a pokemon only to find the game has hard locked your ability to capture it behind badges. No nearly impossible rng capture odds, just a flat ""nope, get on with the scripted gameplay"". The game makes a huge deal out of the ""dynamax"" gimmick, despite it being nothing more than increasing the size and raw stats of the pokemon.

Secondly the wild area and dynamax raids seem fine until you reach the postgame where they become an absolute nightmare due to artificial difficulty and god awful Npc designs. This is seen most clearly in Npc's that use a magikarp or other first line pokemon to fight what is more or less this game's closest thing to legendaries, the gigantamax pokemon which you have extremely limited lives to fight but are nigh unobtainable in an actual online cooperative raid due to extremely lowered catch rates, forcing players to solo with said Npc's. Which brings me to the point of the online play, whenever I'm not being randomly dropped from trades or battles, which no longer have friend to friend matchmaking but instead use a 4 digit code system to 'connect' players who know eachother, I'm lamenting the lack of the Global Trade System which Gamefreak pioneered on the DS. The main story is a complete cakewalk with minimal dialog and actual depth compared to previous entries and there is a major game breaking glitch in the post game where not using the only master ball in the game on the version exclusive legendary(yes it is only caught in post game) can result in your game crashing repeatedly. Now onto the latest gimmick of dynamaxing and gigantamaxing, dynamax would be nice if you could use it anywhere but sadly it can only be used in 3 select instances: gym battles, raids and story battles. As for gigantamax it is bad enough that the pokemon capable of doing so have a dismal spawn rate, but their inability to pass on the trait that allows them to gigantamax and the significantly lowered catch rates compared to every other pokemon in the game makes them hardly worth obtaining. As far as the positives for the game go it does meet the definition of a pokemon game and I don't discourage others from playing it, however read the above grievances should any of those gameplay aspects weigh in on your decision to purchase.</span>",Some intentional decisions were made.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBTBRISIAYUBEGY3N7AWTLYS25Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Pokemon Sword and Shield are the worst mainline Pokemon game to date. Gamfreaks cuts more than 50% of Pokemon, removing moves, mega evolutions, and endgame contents without adding any improvement they promised. Most of the Pokemon model is proven identical to 3ds pokemon model which means they lied, because in the interview they said the reason they can't bring all the Pokemon is because they had to make all the models from scratch which is proven is not the case<br><br>2)I really wish the games were good. I don't leave this review out of spite, but because I love the series. For the positives, I like some of the new designs. On top of that, most Pokemon get additional moves, giving them more variety in combat. Besides that, it's a Pokemon game with serious added flaws. Though it was a trend set in earlier games, the new games are more linear and less secret filled than ever. Dungeons are more akin to hallways instead labyrinths with branching paths and abundant secrets. There are very few routes in the game, and the ones that exist are mostly short and lack complexity. The wild area feels half baked and unfinished. After the short main campaign, all that's left for you is a short side story and a Battle Tower. Besides that, you're entirely reliant on playing online for content.<br><br>As a gimmick, Dynamax against other players is frustrating and poorly balanced. One wrong move and you're down two or even three mons. This is especially devastating in 3v3 matches, it feels even more poorly balanced than the previous battle gimmicks, Mega Evolution and Z-moves.<br><br>It's painful to see the series hit this low. I wanted this to be good, but wading through the major flaws to get to the small nuggets of good simply isn't worth it. The games aren't irredeemable, but it's really hard to recommend it when it drops the ball so hard</span>",Not worth the 60 dollar price tag.

Ever since then I fell in love with Pokémon and played all the games up until the 3DS games due to college and such. This is the first Pokémon game that I have played since coming back into it and let me just tell you I’ve never been so disappointed so much in a Nintendo game in my life before.<br><br>First off, the XP share makes the game way way too easy. It used to be a hassle to try to level up a Magikarp But now it is so easy to get a Gyarados it’s kinda dumb easy.  Back in my day in order to Catch up One pocket monster to get to the level of the rest of Your Pokémon you would have to put it on your hot bar first to where it comes out and then hurry up and switch it to one of your other stronger Pokémon because back then any Pokémon who is in the battle would share XP. But now every single Pokémon in your party gets XP.<br><br>The rendering distance is awful. You can see the artwork in the background and everything just fine but you can’t see NPCs and Pokémon until your 10 feet away. I know that the switch isn’t exactly a powerhouse when it comes to hardware but I know that it’s better than that.<br><br>I read somewhere online that game freak cut a bunch of Pokémon so you can perfect it’s animations but honestly with the exception of a few special animations they all look kind of generic. Again with the previous point I know that the switches hardware isn’t exactly the best but I know it’s better than this.<br><br>Overall the game is just plain to easy. The campaign is too short. The story is predictable and the new Pokemon is just ‘eh.’ This game made me realize that my golden days of video games has long past me and new editions of my favorite game series back in the day are only to get the younger generation to enjoy it.

This game still holds true to that but they added a gym challenge to spice things up. Gym challenges are certain objectives u have to do while you're also beating the trainers and its just so much fun and the scenery as u walk in is so breathtaking :) once u complete the challenge, the doors open and tons of people r cheering making u feel like actual pokemon trainer :D When the first gym leader dynamxed his pokemon, it makes things a bit tougher as it did way more damage than what i expected it to even though his pokemon isnt super effective against mine. That forced me to dynamax and set up defensive moves such as light screen and reflect and held up just in time for the 3 turns to be over and his pokemon reversed back to being tiny. I ended up beating the gym with red hp. The second gym was easy to beat since i had an electric type corgi and the 3rd gym gave me a bit of a challenge since i didnt have any pokemon with type advantages but still managed to win my second time around :)<br><br>This game has more freedom to roam around when ur done interacting with the main characters and theres lots of hidden stuff on the roads that shine as ur passing through. The diversity of old and new pokemon is outstanding as well. Theres lots of pokemon to choose from in every route. Even in the beginning of ur journey, u can start fishing with ur fishing rod so u can mix and match the perfect team from the start :) i would also advise being very careful in the wild area because i got my butt kicked with a level 45 Galvantula while i was just level 12. I was lucky to escape with my last pokemon still unfainted xD i was dumb enough to interact with it since i thought i would be lucky enough to catch it but found out u have to beat a certain amount of gyms in order to catch high level pokemon or else it'll just tell u that it wont let its guard down. Its the same concept as having a certain amount of gym badges to make high level pokemon from trades obey u. I had to find out the hard way lol<br><br>Now for the designs of the new pokemon and graphics of the games. Everyone has their own opinions on this ever since it was announced that there was gonna be no national dex. Personally, i avoided the leaks so idk what im expecting to get. So far, i love every single pokemon i have come across. Some r weird and funny looking but they do grow on u as u figure out they are really good in battles :) when they evolved, i still love the designs and was so surprised of the typings that were added and became even more useful to keep in ur team. It is true that many battle move animations and models r reused from past games but it really shouldnt matter all that much as alot of old moves have new animations and the pokemon's colors and textures look way better than the previous generations. The graphics in the wild area is the best ive seen except for the trees. The weird part is, the berry trees in the wild area look completely fine and fit well with the good graphics so my guess is that the company didnt really bother making those normal trees look as good since u cant interact with them at all and in my opinion thats completely fine. The graphics in the towns, caves, and routes are completely breathtaking so theres nothing negative i can say there :)<br><br>Despite lack of national dex i will say this. Overall, this game deserves its 5 stars and worth every penny. The variety of pokemon, the fun battles, and both ur awesome and jerk rivals make it a really fun experience for both oldschool and new trainers to enjoy. As i stated, i avoided every single thing about this game besides the announcement trailers from pokemon and nintendo so i was nervous since so many people were stating that the animations were garbage. Playing this game, i just dont see anything wrong with how it looks and how the pokemon move. The game and its scenery looks absolutely beautiful. I really recommend this game to at least be given a chance. I know it will be worth the gameplay :)</span>",Way better than you think! :D,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYL4KDFPZ4E5NP5KMY5CP7OGH4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

No game is perfect, but faults are part of what makes something interesting. However, Pokemon Sword deserves these five stars. I haven’t finished the game, but so far I have been delighted, and it has met and exceeded my expectations. And that’s really all anyone could ask for. Could all of that change by the time I’ve finished? Yes. But I don’t anticipate that happening.<br><br>I have played every main series Pokemon game since I got Pokemon Blue when I turned seven. Some games have been better than others; however, Pokemon Sword is settling in right there at the top. The game looks amazing; the new monsters are some of my favorites in years; the new Galar region is hands down the most immersive region so far; and the story is there, and I’m probably about halfway through, and I haven’t predicted the whole thing yet, so that’s great (although, I believe playing Pokemon for the story is like . . . well . . . you just don’t play Pokemon for the story)!<br><br>Pokemon Sword seems to have been very carefully thought out, and it takes everything that’s great about Pokemon and builds on it. Pokemon has always been about exploring new places, meeting new friends, and looking at the bright side, all while fighting for the glory of becoming the Champion and beating the bad guys! Pokemon Sword does all these wonderfully. And, while it’s a little cheesy, I have never felt so epic walking into a gym battle than I do in this game!<br><br>Now to address the almighty controversy of the missing National Pokedex. Yes, it’s gone. Do I miss it? A little. There are definitely some Pokemon I’m bummed I can’t use in this game, but let’s be real. You can only have six Pokemon in your party anyway. There are more than enough great Pokemon to choose from, and I will be even happier to see my favorites when they come back. And at the rate they’ve been putting out Pokemon games lately, that probably won’t be too far in the future. They were right when they said that limiting Pokemon would have to happen eventually. I don’t care if they have all the storage space in the world to work from, or every single Pokemon is perfectly pre-designed and ready to pop in the game. Having that many options is overwhelming. The last time I caught every single Pokemon in a Pokemon game was in Pokemon X, and I’m still trying to decide if catching ‘em all was an enjoyable experience or not. And yeah, for those who have favorite Pokemon they’ve been training and carrying with them from game to game and suddenly can’t use them, that does suck. But it’s not like those Pokemon have been erased. They’re still useful in previous games, and they’ll be again in future games. Pokemon Sword is simply a chance to try something new!<br><br>In short, I know my nephews (ages 6-12) will love this game! I really enjoy it too! Pokemon has always been, and should always be, designed for children. And they’ve nailed it this time. It can’t be designed for everyone. That’s a bad business strategy. I'm just glad I get to join in on the fun!</span>",A great new generation!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGF6IY6HCZR7H7N5EJNB5EELB5OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

But at some point we need to be honest with ourselves.<br><br>This game has no content. It's like someone built the skeleton of a Pokemon game but forgot to add the meat. Remember the old games where you had to overcome some obstacle to make it to a new city? A winding cave? A twisting forest? Or perhaps you had to complete a side objective before the gym leader would face you--Stopping Team Rocket in some scheme or finding a solution to a problem plaguing the town? Gone. All of that is gone. The game is quite literally just a series of linear hallway ""routes"" funneling you from one gym battle to the next. And since the game has been stripped of all its side content, contests and casinos and quests and the like, there's nothing to do in each city other than find the couple NPCs who will give you a free item. That's it. No reason to hang around, nothing barring you from proceeding.<br><br>And then there's the difficulty. Or the lack thereof. I read a review claiming this was the most difficult Pokemon game yet. I know not what that reviewer was smoking. The game throws so many pokemon at you so quickly that I had caught over 30 before I hit the first gym. Which meant I had a full team of six with diverse type coverage. And the automatic Exp. All means you will never have an underleveled team. I never came close to wiping out once and I beat the last several gyms with only one Pokemon, one-shotting everything that was thrown at me. All without ever grinding for even a minute.<br><br>I could go on about the story and such as some reviewers do, or address the smaller Pokedex (which personally I was fine with) but they seem irrelevant next to such sparse gameplay. It is a game, after all, which means the playing of it should be the highest priority. And I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the youngest, brand-newest Pokemon fans looking for the easiest possible entry into the series. But if you're an established player, or perhaps a potential new fan looking to give the series a spin now that it's on shiny modern hardware, move along. The game simply has nothing to offer beyond full 3d models. Which admittedly is a lot of fun and is the reason I am willing to give 2 stars rather than 1, in addition to the fact that it is technically a fully functional game, unlike many titles released these days.</span>",This game makes me sad at what could have been.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAJDCCTZQ2MSCQBHTBY44EBKPCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It took me just as long to complete the main storyline for this game as it did for pretty much any other predecessor pokemon game, and the storyline plays out like most main title pokemon games, which I dont particularly mind. I absolutely loved the gym battles and found them exciting. The characters are colorful and the camping feature is a fun way to bond with pokemon. In terms of the main issue that majority people seem to have with this game, yes, I am sad that not all the pokemon are there and that even my absolute faves arent in here. However, I think that plays more into the sentiment most of us long term players have with pokemon we've carried with us throughout generations. Taking these games as they are, theyre fun and beautiful.

That was 25 years ago, and I remember receiving a GameBoy Color and Pokemon red and blue for my birthday. Discovering the world of Pokemon at the time was amazing. Future games were great too, but your first time only happens once. Somehow, this game made that happen again for me.<br><br>Positives:<br>+The story is interesting (although your rival can get in the way of it sometimes)<br>+The Dynamax/Gigantamax system is much more interesting that I thought it would be from previews. Dynamax actually works to make multiplayer more fun as well and isn't the overpowered gimmick I anticipated.<br>+Animations are beautiful<br>+There are a lot of nice quality of life improvements that the game lets you access immediately or very early in the story. These include a character that can really run, a bike, access to your stored boxes almost anywhere, and on-the-go online functions like trading and battling that don't require you to be anywhere specific.<br>+The new Wild Areas revolutionize the series and are an important part of the game.

With all the clothing, hair, eye, and skin tone options, this would be an easy addition, and a huge gift to fans who started this series as children and still play as adults.<br>-I don't think I can write a review about this game without mentioning the National Dex controversy. Yes, most of my favorite Pokemon are now missing in action. As I've played, however, this has become a non-issue and I have found others that I am familiar with or new ones to love. We've also been told that future games will probably have Dex limitations as well, but that currently excluded Pokemon will be present in those.

I have never judged a book by its cover and am always willing to try something out before formulating a solid opinion, but this game is just... it's a lot of things. I kept my pre-order up despite being skeptical with each new trailer, and I hate to say that I ended up feeling less than satisfied with just about every aspect of this game. I want to get into why I feel like Pokemon Sword and Shield just aren't worth your money.<br><br>Pokemon games have always been formulaic and targeted at a younger audience, and that's perfectly fine. When your base game works well, why change it? Instead, expand on ideas, content, and mechanics to keep things fresh and engaging. If you can't build up, build out! That's not the case here. For the first mainline game on Switch, playing it felt hollow and empty. The routes between cities and towns are basically straight lines with only a few trainers and nothing to explore. The Wild Area is honestly quite good and mostly well-executed, but the performance issues are glaring. Once you comb through the Wild Area, that's basically all of the exploration and discovery the game has to offer. The Story is a dumpster fire of adults telling you ""Nah bro, just go to the next gym, we'll handle the threat."" and the handholding is a little excessive.<br><br>I stretched out my playtime by talking to every npc, frequently setting up camp, returning to the Wild Area after every gym, and playing around with my trainer outfit. But there's just not a lot of content here. The game is excruciatingly short, only padded by the various times npcs stop you dead in your tracks to tell you something you already know. I'm not going to go into detail about the reused models and cut Pokemon, but both of those are a huge blow to this game, and only make me feel worse when I think about it. Pocket Monsters has had the slogan ""Gotta Catch 'em All"" since the beginning, and as the biggest media franchise in the world? Cutting a chunk of them out feels incredibly lazy, not to mention insulting, after the fans were lied to about the reasons for cutting said Pokemon.<br><br>To set the record straight, I love that this is the first Pokemon game that people have played with their kids, and that they genuinely enjoy it. While I feel that this game isn't worth the 60$ I paid for it, I'm seriously happy that people are having fun. That's the point of video games-- to have fun. The Switch is a great console for families and I'm glad that its bringing people together to dive into the franchise. That being said, I'll go ahead and talk about some things that I liked about the game.<br><br>The graphics looks nice. Aside from the pop-in, mismatched trees, and lazy animations, the overall look of the game is innocent, cartooney, vibrant, and a little nostalgic. Overall, it does look nice and I really love the color palette. I also really like the new evolution methods for certain Pokemon, they were cryptic but clever, and it was fun trying to figure out the trick to evolving certain ones. Lastly, I do really like the new Pokemon designs! While I understand it's subjective, I felt that the new roster was very solid and diverse. Also, I do actually like the Pokemon Camp feature, it just needs some tweaking.<br><br>With the Expansion Passes on the horizon, I sadly just can't say that I'm confident. It's too little too late. Even if the expansions are really good, paying for that on top of a 60$ half-baked game just makes me feel depressed.<br><br>I can't really recommend this.</span>",Very Disappointing,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGW3R3ZOU7RL4RTY464PRMEMWI5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Bank is 5 USD per year, and Home has a month long subscription, and a year long subscription. But here's where things can get ugly for you. Say you have a shiny garchomp in pokemon Sun. You move it to bank then move it again into pokemon home, because home can accommodate any pokemon with any move. You then learn that your garchomp has a move that doesn't exist in pokemon Sword, so now you have this pokemon that can't be moved back into pokemon bank and can't be moved into sword. That hypothetical situation actually isn't hypothetical at all. Option one: I continue paying for pokemon home so my garchomp doesn't get obliterated into a billion randomized 1s and 0s, or Option two: I stop giving Game Freak my money and watch my garchomp, rayquaza and Articuno from my LeafGreen game get obliterated.

I straight finished the story in under thirty hours.  The lack of challenges is noticeable because the game just tells you where to go.  Their is no more having to find the move to train your Pokemon to cut down trees, strength to move boulders, or swimming to get across the river.  This game just hands it to you and there is no challenge whatsoever.  Heck whatever starter Pokemon you pick you'll be 99% of the game one shot dropping opponents Pokemon all the time.  The difficulty is this game is severely lacking.  This game is straight garbage can juice and avoid it as much as possible.  Rent it if you really want to play it but, do not buy.

Most fans of the series will get a good amount of enjoyment out of this game, but not without wishing there was a bit more or that some features worked better.  The character models look incredible, but a lot of the battle animations are pretty basic.  Doesn't seem to be as many unique NPCs in this game as there were in previous games, but that probably won't bother too many.  The main story in recent games always seemed to go by very fast, no exception with these two new games.  The Pokedex is pretty small and easy to complete.  I do wish they at least included a bit more Pokemon in the dex.  I'm sure most fans will find at least a few 'mon they wish were included in these games.  The online mode is a bit hit or miss.  The game noticeably stutters while playing online in the ""Wild Area"" and the Y-link system for finding online raids doesn't consistently work.  Hopefully online play will see some improvements soon.  I've put over 100 hours into this game and will probably put in a good bit more over the coming weeks.

Couldn't double battles be saved for end-game content not away too make beating the story a breeze please.<br>* I cannot transfer Typhlosion or Lugia.<br>* holding back Pokemon that Gamefreak said previously for reasons you cannot put them in the game at first it was understood, but It would seem that your true intions was too lie in order to sell them back to us because you think you can get away with it. (of course you can, your Gamefreak). NOT COOL GAMEFREAK!<br>* saving the best for last the creation of team yell I've talked with other fans who agree with me and they think that team yell is a waste of space. They might as well have created Pokemon Sword and Shield without an evil team. They wern't even evil, more like either confused or they just served to get in your way without a cause. That is team yell is problem. They are just a reskin of team skull which even though I felt like I couldn't take them seriously many times they at least had a cause under Guzma. So far the best evil teams in my opinion are team rocket and team flare. I miss the old days. They probably made team yell this way so they wouldn't have too delay the game.<br><br>Pros:<br>* It's a very pretty game but it is in no way leap in graphics based off of the Switch's own hardware because they used the 3DS engine and just enhanced it. I am willing too admit it's pretty.<br>* The wild area is expansive. It felt like a first-time open world Pokemon game so I'll give Gamefreak some credit for this idea but the trees do look like N64 trees.<br>* Dynamax battles and Pokemon are a challenge to catch them I especially found that to be true with Dynamax Machamp. But the gyms are too damn easy.<br>* League cards and pokejobs are cool.<br><br>Originally I was going to be a proud boycotter and refuse to play the game but I didn't want to regurgitate what others are saying because if someone asked me if I played it then my answer would be ridiculous and uncredible. So I bought it used. Was it worth it? While I did have fun team yell and Hop were the most annoying parts of the game to be fair for now I will probably say the jury is still out on this one. I can't say for sure I do still play the game I like customizing my avatar I do intend to buy the DLC. Based on the way Gamefreak treated this game I don't feel like their team deserves praise for it or money so I recommend that you buy it used if your interested.

I’ve played nearly every generation so far except 2, 4, and 7, but will get around to doing so. Sword is imo one of my favorites in the franchise. The game itself ran well for me. I had a fun time playing it and I think the new Pokémon from the Galar region were for the most part well designed. The game at its core is still the same old Pokémon. You catch Pokémon, battle trainers, compete against gyms, save the world, and become champion.<br><br>Graphically, the game looks really good. The Galar region was one of my favorites to adventure across. One thing I particular liked with this game was big wild areas where Pokémon an abundance of Pokémon ran free for you to catch or battle. Plus I liked how the tall grass functioned where you could slowly sneak through it, see the Pokémon, and if you ran through it, startled unseen Pokémon. I thought this was a cool change. I was playing through Yellow on the 3DS prior to this game and I definitely do not miss how the tall grass worked in previous games. Another new feature is “dynamax” and “gigantamax”. This essentially replaces mega evolution and I think it’s much better.

While I agree with this, it’s not a dealbreaker. I like EXP share, I like that HMs are no more.

It was just a textual reference, but the use of the term ""occult"" made it pretty explicit. Spiritual entities aren't uncommon concepts, but as a Catholic I would prefer that games not make light of subjects with grave moral/spiritual implications. Again, I know it's partly Japanese culture, and Pokemon games/shows have always had some references to occult (similar to ""that fortune teller episode"" in Avatar: The Last Airbender), so just be ready to exercise some intellect and faith if you have younger children that you want to enjoy Pokemon without being malformed/getting the wrong idea (which you should be doing for pretty much everything they do anyways).<br><br>Looking forward to the DLC.</span>",First time I caught 'em all since Gen I,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGP5VZPMZIKEG7ABQMCR4PE2QWZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ignoring that it's missing more than half of the Pokedex; the game is still just the same Pokemon you've been playing for decades now. Very few new things are brought to the table and anything newly implemented is half-hearted.<br><br>Everything about this titles feels incredibly rushed. Hopes are high at first when you're plopped down relatively quickly into the open-world-esque environment, your dreams get dashed almost immediately when you see how terrible it all looks. Graphically, this game is hideous. Poor textures, lowly detailed open-world environments look bland; complete with horrible pop-in. I have reason to believe the New 3DS was capable of the same graphical fidelity.<br><br>Story has never been a strong point for the Pokemon series but it's never been this bad! By the time the end credits rolled, I continued pressing 'A' as if I was just trying to get through another boring random battle. As normal, AI is brain-dead and other trainers use no specific tactic to even try to challenge it's players. Online connectivity is horrible and confusing. Even something as simple as just trading with a local friend is like jumping through hoops. The raid battle are laughable and a good portion of them can be done with the AI.<br><br>This is just a trimmed down version of Pokemon really. It's not better or worse in terms of combat. The gimmick for this Pokemon entry is making your Pokemon really big and they have flashy move-sets that look really cool. But by the time you're just a few gym badges in, you realize this is nothing more than flash. Most of the time, it's a complete waste of time to even Dynamax your Pokemon. You could have simply mutilated your opponent with the amount of time it takes to watch the animation of your Pokemon becoming a behemoth.<br><br>If you love Pokemon, you'll probably still get entertainment from these titles, but me?

My Zigzagoon became gigantic and that kind of sold the function for me. Its a ton of fun being able to make any 1 pokemon strong for 3 turns.<br><br>Its like a lazy version of mega pokemon, the low turn rate on the gigantimax forms just makes it feel like some temporary gimmick.<br><br>Beyond that, they have this big world zone where people are supposed to be able to interact to cooperate in order to catch gigantic pokemon.<br><br>Online functionality really sucked because it seemingly never found anyone to play with and consequently I had to team up with the random NPCs that they offered.<br><br>I really enjoyed the wonder trades of previous games, this one takes forever to find trade partners.<br><br>I needed to trade with a real life friend of mine who was quite literally across from me in the room. Rather than being able to trade wirelessly like previous games, it insisted that I connect to online. After doing so, they offered no function to invite my friend directly to trade, instead I had to do this dumb 4 digit number code. My friend then matched my code and hoped that we would be paired as trading partners. One time I was matched with some random person online while expecting to trade with my friend, this in particular frustrated me considerably.<br><br>Also its worth noting that, of all the times for my Nintendo Online subscription to run out, it was on that specific day.<br><br>So you will need Nintendo Online if you wish to trade pokemon....yup.<br><br>As a story, this game gets up to the Elite Four equivalent and then basically just has this stupid detour where you have to do a bunch of other things.

I wanted the game to end, I was legitimately bored after the 4th badge.<br><br>I actually enjoyed the new characters and region within this game, and the new pokemon were actually pretty cool.<br><br>With all of that being said, I would've played this game regardless because it is a pokemon main series game.<br><br>Sun/Moon was previously my least favorite within the series.

The characters are interesting but annoying. You’ll be constantly interrupted in your adventure by your rivals who hold your hand through the entirety of the storyline. Sadly, there’s little room to deviate from the intended plot progression, which makes it feel less like exploring a world and more like reading a book.<br><br>Post game:<br>There isn’t really much of a post game plot. There are multiplayer and battle tower options. Because of GF’s decision to eliminate the National dex, the ranked battles have very little variety of Pokémon, making it pretty boring. The battle tower isn’t new but is fun.<br><br>Mechanics changes:<br>No more HMs, no national dex, GTS is gone, multiplayer is revamped, making your Pokémon gigantic is now a thing. Most of these changes are okay. The lack of the GTS makes trading difficult online, especially since there isn’t a way to communicate with other players. The raid co-op invitations only work some of the time, both connected to the internet and local. The graphics aren’t a huge leap forward and are still lagging behind many other switch games. One area in the game allows rotating the camera, which is both new and welcome.<br><br>Overall impressions:<br>The new Pokémon designs are pretty great and the characters aren’t flat. I didn’t really enjoy the story and the side plot didn’t really kick into gear until the story was nearly over. The post game is very weak and the game is quickly growing boring. I’d still buy again but this game is relatively boring when compared to other Pokémon generations.<br><br>Edit Jan 2020:<br>Pokémon recently announced they will sell extra downloadable content. It’s $30 per version but will offer two new areas, new plots, and 200+ more Pokémon than originally available. Hopefully this addresses the main issues with the post game and ranked battles.</span>",Kid friendly but not interesting,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3YQPSQ6BD2ACGYPW5R7WK7SXRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

A few tweeks to the story (yes, there is a story other than ""collect the 8 things to challenge some slightly stronger people"") make it a decent game.<br><br>I'm not one to mind losing half the dex. There hasn't been a Pokemon game in over 10 years that actually let you catch every pokemon in the game anyways, so this doesn't really affect me or my opinion of this game.<br><br>The only actually thing I dislike about this game is that it doesn't feel like the second highest grossing video game franchise in history. It feels like a cheaper Chinese knock off. By no means does it always feel like this, but when compared to Odyssey or Breath of the Wild, it feels like they cheaped out a bit. Still very enjoyable, but you can see where they tried to save money.<br><br>If you dont care (or have the time) to catch all 1,000 pokemon, and dont mind the occasional trash graphics in non-battle areas, and like pokemon, you cant go wrong with this game! If, however, you're very upset that some 500 pokemon wont make it into a game where you wouldn't even be able to catch them in the game, just wait until the mid-generation refresh when they'll bring all the pokemon back (let's be real, the ONLY reason Gamefreak cut all the pokemon is because they want to play the good guy when they bring all the Pokemon back in Sword and Shield).<br><br>In short, the outrage over this game is overblown in my opinion.

First, there were no issues receiving or downloading the game, so my complaints are entirely to do with the game itself.<br><br>Game Freak simply didn’t change enough about the Pokémon formula with this game. That became apparent when I still had to sit through an hour or so of unskippable exposition to finally get to the real game, which itself felt like a carbon copy of every other Pokémon game I have ever played. Not to mention that the graphics and move animations were not up to par with the Switch’s capabilities. In fact, I didn’t really see much of a graphical difference between this and the 3ds games before it.<br><br>The graphics aren’t really a huge problem, but I don’t feel like I should be spending $60 on something so similar to the original games. Because that’s what it really comes down to: this game doesn’t have enough originality and novelty to make me feel good about my purchase.<br><br>I haven’t played the online part of this game, so I have no opinions either way regarding it.</span>",Very disappointed,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGU3IQJ5N6TFVVJPQZK2UQW2KDLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

A console pokemon game with a battle system that isn't milking the tit of Pokemon Go! The story was as good as you'd expect a Pokemon game story to get. Actually, in my opinion it was the second-best story (after X/Y). This game contains many quality of life improvements. It is now easier to fill your Pokedex as long as you want to pursue that. Leveling pokemon isn't hard at all. You get experience share from the beginning, and all of the raids drop experience candy that you can use on any pokemon. Super helpful if you got a pokemon and you just want to evolve it for the dex entry. Pop it an XL Exp candy and boom. Instant levels. The Pokedex event makes recommendations to you with 1-3 pokemon you can catch right then to fill out the dex, and shows you where you might find them. The daily weather system adds a lot of dynamics to the game, making it possible to only catch certain pokemon in that kind of weather.<br><br>But the best part of the experience is the Gym challenge. For the first time do you really feel like you are a pro taking on a league. Battles in a stadium. Walking out onto the turf. Fans cheering. Customizable trading cards. Epic music.

Galar has some great new Pokémon, but there’s a few complaints: The main story is very simple (not overly engaging), the town to town gym battle left very little for exploration post-game (outside of the Wilds) and even while playing, and the Wilds was an amazing idea but it just feels like it is still in beta testing.<br><br>I would definitely still recommend this game (giving 4/5 stars) as it has a solid introduction of raid concepts (sort of transferred from Pokémon Go?), and the weather-based concept for catching Pokémon is interesting (but it encourages spoofing to get the weather you “need”), also endgame Battle Tower &amp; hyper training is great for those beyond casual players.<br><br>If you’re still reading, go ahead and get it. But just know that some things will feel like a let down... but overall, there’s something exciting about a new Gen of Pokémon &amp; starting the new era of Switch/Switch Lite games. I’m interested to see how Pokémon Go/Let’s Go/Sword&amp;Shield will lead into Gen 9 or the revamp of Gen 8.<br><br>TL;DR: Solid intentions, but a story and formatting let down.

I’m sure everyone and region will have full backstory in the anime series, but this game.. nope. Even the badguy reveals himself the very last moment and you take him on with ease. Only Hop, that is at your face every 5-15mins, has some character depth. The new dynamax feature I got to use very little throughout game. When you do use it the music fades out and feels like I’m waterlogged. So much is water-down, the gyms aren’t as exciting as they appear. After the third one you just want to finish them as quickly as possible. —There’s even a joke about that from one of the npc trainers. The wild area isn’t as big as suggested. Camping is more like a sleeping/AFK feature than gameplay. Charizard isn’t that cool in this and they know it.

I don't EV/IV Train, I don't worry about competitive, and I don't make 'roid rage Clefables with meticulously crafted Effort Values and Movesets. If that's what you play these games for, I won't be much help.<br><br>I'm also not a picky consumer - much of the controversy surrounding this game is around the number of Pokemon from previous games that were ""culled"", and while I'm a bit bummed that some of my favorites aren't in the game, it doesn't offend my sensibilities and I don't feel like Nintendo or Gamefreak desecrated my familial burial site because of it. I bought this game with full knowledge that we were working with a smaller pool of Pokemon.<br><br>With that all being said:<br><br>- PRO: Gameplay on the Switch is fun. I've really loved watching the Pokemon series evolve with the systems they're on. The environments are gorgeous, and the world feels more lived in than usual.<br>- PRO: Wild Area, while it has its bugs, is overall a fantastic addition to the game. Seeing other players messing around and just having the access and ability to so many Pokemon so early in the game is great for me, someone who doesn't play competitive, as it gives me more options to use during my playthrough since I'm not concerned about much else.<br>- PRO: The music for the game is fantastic. The gym music really gets me hyped. It's everything 10 year old me dreamed of and more.<br>- PRO: Leveling seems to have been simplified and made easier for ease of use and accessibility. Some of you may hate it. For me, it's time I don't have to sink into superfluous crap. I'm here to game, not take a second job.<br>- CON: For a main line Pokemon game, this feels a bit...short. Maybe it's been too long since standard Sun and Moon and it's the same length it's always been, but to me at least, it seemed shorter than usual. This is exacerbated a little by the lack of ""minigames"" to me, as I spent a lot of time doing the surfing and other stuff in Sun/Moon. Again, I could 100% be forgetting if Sun and Moon was a little barren as its been a while and I had no major complaints<br>- CON: as a follow up to the last point, not much post game stuff. I think there's battle tower and you can replay a mini-gym challenge, but that seems to be about it.<br>- CON: this one's more of a personal gripe, but the catch rates on Gigantamaxed Pokemon is so abyssmal that you'll want to temper your expectations there. Rates on them are also absurdly low (to even encounter) so if you're someone who wants to collect every version of every thing, you might have a couple years of gameplay here.<br><br>Overall, I think this is a great game. It doesn't deviate from the formula, and if you like Pokemon games usually, you'll probably like this one.</span>","More of the Same, if that's your style.",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGVJIP4PTB4VQJJUDGPCZT7RUBDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Without spoiling anything, I'll say that it was enjoyable. Interesting change to the primary gimmick by making the gyms all compete with one another. I didn't feel too compelled to do any of the post-game content as I mostly enjoy catching new Pokemon and trying out new teams.<br><br>The multiplayer gimmick of fighting giant powered-up Pokemon in dens is both really fun and terrible. You can see a den on the list, select it, and then promptly be told that it's full or closed. Weirdly, this doesn't remove it from the list and there's few moments when it will refresh. So you could have a full list of dens and have none of them available.<br><br>Conversely, I've found that ""unpopular"" dens (an event Pokemon that outstays its welcome for example) will struggle to fill up. A 5-star den is a breeze with 4 competent players, but if you try to do it solo or with one other person, the NPCs are a complete gamble.<br><br>I had some fun playing it in the evening after I beat it, but eventually the fun tapered off. It's a shame, too, as this one should've been easy to complete the Dex for. Frustratingly, one of the Pokemon only spawns in a specific region with certain weather conditions. Could not get it to show up at all. Trading's a bit of a pain so sadly I fell off the game before I could round out the Dex,<br><br>I'll see if the upcoming DLC brings me back in.

Usually in the other games, you battle the enemy team or they cause some mischief and you have to deal with them first but thats not the case here and it was kind of disappointing<br><br>2) very babied down, with Hop talking to every minute and even while battling. They tell you what moves are supereffective and which are not (tho not if you do not have the pokedex entry). And the battles are too easy, why do I keep winning!?! The champion was too easy. I need a Cynthia okay<br><br>3) I love Pokemon Camp. My favorite thing to do is going to the camp and just watching my Pokemon interact and play with them. I want to make a 100 curries and its just so much fun.<br><br>4) I like that you get the exp share build in cuz that way I was able to switch my team around and not be stuck with the 5 i got in the beginning of the game and 1 HM slave speaking of which I love that there are no HMs in this game<br><br>5) the game is short took me 24 hours to reach the champion and I normally do not play post game but finding Pokemon to fill the pokedex is so much easier and fun than previous games that I am actually attempting to complete the dex. The surprise trade feature has helped a lot since I do not have the Shield version of the game. I do wish I could add a friend instead of just exchanging cards with them and never know any updates about them.<br><br>That is all I have to say, it is still a very enjoyable game, wish there was a hard mode but customizing your character, the wild area, pokemon camp, the league, the pokemon are very great.

This game did not disappoint. It took me almost 10 hours to get the first four badges then the game speeds up and I beat it in about 16 hours. This is probably my 3rd or 4h favorite pokemon game after soul silver and sun.<br>People need to get over the fact that not all pokemon are in it and that you have to set up your team differently. The real fun of a pokemon game for me is always after you beat the game and catch all the pokemon and do what ever battle tower game they have. The story could have been a little longer but I’m sure for people that are unfamiliar with pokemon will have hours of fun trying to beat the game. I think the looks of the pokemon have come a long way and the graphics are the greatest they have ever been in a pokemon game.<br>My advice buy the game if you like pokemon.

Despite Champion Leon’s connection to the rival of this game, the characters aren’t fleshed out enough. I thought that the gym leaders would get involved in trying to save Galar from the evil that is released halfway through the game (referencing Black and White’s plot), but aside from being worried, they don’t get involved.<br><br>The post-game content here is by far the worst part of this game, Zamazenta and Zacian arrives to help the player against fighting a Dyramaxed monster and once the post-game comes around, the two legendary Pokémon that represents the hero of Galar are renegaded to capture fodder and that’s it, in this game’s case, Zacian comes, acts crazy because some sort of pathetic attempt of descendants or ancestors of the original legendary hero of Galar thought that they could control Zacian and/or Zamazenta? Talk about weak.<br><br>The Pokémon here are great for long time fans of the franchise, but the Galar exclusive roster of Pokémon is very, very weak.<br><br>The camping aspect of this game is interesting enough and prevented me from falling asleep multiple times during the post game.<br><br>I thought Team Yell would’ve been the worse part of the game, but that honor goes to the ancestors of the legendary hero of Galar, alongside the post-game content.<br><br>The graphics and the concept of Dynamaxing was by far the best aspect of this game, the stadiums looks great and sort of 3D is interesting. Gloria and her male counterpart was interesting enough. They look like teenagers rather than your standard 10 year old male and female Pokémon protagonists and I think that’s what makes players not cringe while playing the game.<br><br>This game just feels like soppy seconds from Game Freak and Nintendo.

For new players or old, this is an awesome title that clearly had some serious work put into it compared to its predecessors!

I think this game’s best feature is the wild area and the events. If you’re not into online competitive, you typically will stop playing the game once you beat the league. But what I love about Sword/Shield is that the ever changing wild area and new Gigantamax Pokémon give you a reason to keep playing. I also actually enjoyed the challenge of filling all 400 slots of the Pokedex! And with the DLC coming, I think this game will hold up much better than previous installments. I also got my brother in law and his son into the game- and it’s their first ever Pokémon game- and they’ve gotten the hang of it pretty well.

It's Pokemon. You're probably still going to enjoy many aspects of the game. There's plenty of content in this game to enjoy and I understand that further developing it by including all 890 pokemon would've greatly delayed the release or possibly result in a cut of quality in some other aspect of the game.<br><br>Controls: 3.5/5<br>Moving in the overworld can be annoying probably because of how movement mechanics with the left joystick isn't refined. Maybe I just need for time and practice with it, but steering on the bike can be difficult especially in more narrow areas like in cities. One specific example I ran into was when I was trying to steer to enter a staircase however I over shot the turn. So I turned around but the bike's range of motion for a turn is too large to make a direct turn into the staircase. I was stubborn and tried multiple times to make the turn but ultimately just got off the bike and walked. Very minor annoyance.<br>Trying to climb ladders in the overworld has also been difficult at times. There have multiple times where I have had to fidget around the ladder area to find the right angle of approach to use it.<br><br>Game mechanics: 5/5<br>The core game mechanics were never designed to be overly complex. It's a turn based rpg which is refined and made interesting via strategy utilizing additional mechanics like type adv, EV/IVs, natures, etc. I think this is the greatest appeal of Pokemon games. At face value it is simple enough for young audiences or casual players. However if one wants to delve deeper into customizing their pokemon and teams there is a lot of depth and strategy.<br>Gigantamaxing looks ridiculous because it is but that is the appeal. I initially thought is was stupid but after experiencing it firsthand I enjoy it. It adds an interesting aspect to strategy in battles and the animations for it are very well done. Also seeing a giant, Godzilla-sized Pidove facing you asking for a fight is pretty great.<br>The raids mechanics is great. It covers a wide variety of entertaining game design points. It promotes another type of multiplayer experience outside of competitive battling. Completing them merits a wide variety of useful items and powerful Pokemon to catch. It provides variety to the standard wild battle mechanic.<br>The open world, ""wild area"" has been a great breath of fresh air. Pokemon has always been very linear in progression especially while still completing the storyline. In the preceding games, I have often felt tired of having to trek a linear path to get to the next gym, being confined to encounter the same group of pokemon in the routes leading to the gym. However, with the inclusion of the wild area, I have been able to take breaks from just following the paths of the routes and periodically go back to the wild area to level grind, catch pokemon, or just roam around looking for items or do raid battles. The linear route walking for gyms is still how storyline progression is conducted however it is refreshing to have the option of branching off to take a break from it. Additionally, the wild area has a wide variety of pokemon so you will never be bored of having to encounter the same exact set of pokemon every wild battle. You can easily just bike over to a different section of the wild area to find a new batch of pokemon. There is also a wide range of levels in the wild pokemon which is great for level grinding or to just catch a pokemon already at a high level to speed up preparing for a gym battle.<br><br>Graphics: 5/5<br>I wasn't expecting anything amazing. It's a pokemon game. The bulk of the game content I will be paying attention to is the battle scenes. The animations for the moves are well done and smooth. The only minor issue I've run into is when the camera angles change in battle there's an occasional stutter if I select an attack move just as the camera angle is changing. It doesn't negatively affect my experience of the game though.<br>The open world<br><br>Plot/Dailogue: 3/5<br>When I first started playing this game, I was worried that there would be an obscene amount of cut scenes and dialogue like in Sun and Moon. However, the pacing of when you get stopped to talk with NPCs for the main story is a lot better in this game and the text scroll speed and dialogue length isn't unbearable. That being said, the content of the conversation is very childish/elementary level and the personalities of a lot of characters are often cringe-y (which is honestly to be expected from a game that is marketed to also sell for young children). To this my solution is just skim read and gloss over the storyline. I personally am playing this game because I want to build a competitive team for online battling so the main story is just a means to an end so that I can get to the stage of the game where I can breed and EV train.<br>The main issue I have with Pokemon games lately is that it is in a sense a ""rpg trying to hard to be an rpg while failing to be an rpg"" (if that makes sense). There has been the addition of content to customize the appearance of your character by selecting skin tone/hairstyle/etc as well as selecting outfits. This is as far as customizing your character goes. Which I am fine with because the most important customization aspect of these games is your pokemon and how you build your team.<br>However, I get extremely annoyed at how the NPCs of the games are overly developed in their personalities, dialogue and mannerisms while you are just forced to stand there and only have the text response options of essentially ""Yes"" or ""No (...which eventually leads to a blanketed ""Yes"" for the sake of progressing the story). I get especially irked by the rivals. It often feels like they are overly enigmatic, constantly excited and talkative to compensate for your character having no dialogue and being limited to one word responses.<br><br>Conclusion: It's pokemon. It will always make a great gift for anyone of any age. There is content in the game for anyone to like, especially with the added content and mechanics of this one. There are minor issues with the game however they do not ruin the overall experience that this version has to offer. I have been enjoying playing so far and am looking forward to building competitive teams to use online.</span>","It's Pokemon. Great, safe gift to give.

I had received the switch for xmas and bought Zelda soon after, and that game exceeded all of my expectations so that made my expectations for this game even higher. I loved the first and second gen pokemon games, they were a huge part of my childhood and I replay them every couple of years. I thought a game made nearly 20 years later would be more complex and have more intricacies. Overall the game was lacking, it's basically a straight line to the end of the game, you can't spend hours exploring like you can even on the simple maps of the original pokemon games. I beat this game in 3 days and even got a little bored doing so. There is no exploring under seas, and beating all of the gym leaders and the champion was no challenge at all. I know this is a game technically made for children, but so were the original games and those still hold a challenge for me.

As a person who has played every generation of Pokémon game , I will say that the story felt shorter , and that it was different , more focused on creating a new experience than cashing in on our nostalgia . If you’re on the fence and unsure , I highly encourage you to dive in , the complaints aren’t well founded . Quality of life improvements have made this game a what it is , pc access anywhere , no more HMs , a fast travel system , easier to transfer egg moves , an IV checking item , nature changing mints , IV hyper training in the post game (makes ANY Pokémon viable stat wise) quicker breeding and 2 nurseries , a charm that increases shiny spawn rates and another for critical captures , and hours and hours of online vs and raids . No it isn’t as deep graphically as other games , but gamefreak isn’t a true AAA game company , they are small time accompanied by several other companies that market Pokémon through various media and merchandising . But it is still the best the franchise has ever looked , I felt engaged beginning to end . Camping and playing with your Pokémon was an excellent addition as well , I have spent hours playing with various mons , just to see how they move and play and interact with each other in camp.I love the new Pokémon themselves as well , they are a fairly balanced blend of the aesthetics that have changed between the years , some more humanoid or modern , some have that classic monster look , even just the 3 starters and their evolutions capture this beautifully . And last of all , the competitive is more fun , balanced , and easy to approach than ever . And the addition on the dynamax is just a more balanced combination of Z-moves and Mega-evolution , all Pokémon can do it , it lasts 3 turns , and it in no way will guarantee victory , but can provide a boost to your edge in battle , versus battles are more involved with field placement than ever , status ailments and weather teams are viable again .Just all in all a great experience .</span>",One of the best the franchise has ever made,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLNWJDZRWMBPDDWUBRPDKPE7N7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

At first I thought it wouldn't be an issue for me, I'm mostly casual about Pokemon games. However, when I couldn't carry my favourite Vivillon from Pokemon X across I was kinda bummed.<br><br>Could they have done more? Yes. It feels a bit unpolished... rushed. I feel as if every other Pokemon game I've played were longer experiences. The older games had better caves and routes hands down. Since the Nintendo DS versions, those previous games also had more Pokemon to play with. There are older games on the Switch that look better than this, but it doesn't look bad. Some human voice acting really wouldn't hurt, but overall the music is well done.<br><br>I don't care too much for Dynamax, this version's gimmick which makes Pokemon extremely large. You get really cool items for doing it, so I take part in them + the gyms have them. However, I'm not excited by it. &lt;rant&gt;To be honest, I don't know why they stopped doing Mega Evolutions, they could have made that life long instead of a gimmick.&lt;/rant&gt;<br><br>The Wild Area is a special place that gives you a freedom to roam the Pokemon world in different habitats. Since I've been playing Breath of the Wild, it doesn't really feel open to me (maybe not their fault). It's still pretty nice. However, it never felt not critical. When I got tired of catching and wanted to advance the plot, I just stuck to the routes and the game didn't care one bit.<br><br>Unlike previous games, in this game you cannot catch Pokemon that are a higher level than you. That simple mechanic made the Wild Area less appealing for me. Masterminding how to take down a level 40 Pokemon with my party of 20s was pretty fun and I would have really liked to catch it.<br><br>The story is ""meh"" at best. Aside from Black/White, these games never made an attempt for a story. And that's fine, I think if they stuck with the sports theme without distractions this game would have been better off.<br><br>It sounds pretty negative, but otherwise it's a great experience. It's a standard Pokemon game, really great mechanics that hasn't gotten old as yet. They also made a lot of quality of life improvements with regards to moving around the world and moves which are definitely welcomed. I'm looking forward to the DLC as well. And generally, I'm still having a good time with it.<br><br>If you like Pokemon, pick this one up! If you're new to the main game series, this is the most usable one by far.</span>",Pretty fun!

The game has absolutely cheapened itself almost beyond all recognition, the graphics are incredibly disappointing given what we’ve come to expect from Mario odyssey and Zelda breath of the wild, and the game play has gotten so easy you’re almost guaranteed to not ever fail.  When I first played as a teen I was enthralled with the challenge and strategy. Now a 5 year old could play it.  The game had vapid storyline and completely robs your player of any agency to play the game on your own. I agree with a lot of the other constructive negative reviews already posted. I waited in anticipation for the next great Pokémon adventure and I’m so sad at what was produced here.

Speaking of which, the battles also have a lot more impact (especially the gym battles). Great usage of camera angles and amazing sound direction makes them more satisfying.

The graphics were great and the game was fun but I felt like the game itself was rushed. There were hardly any side quests or other activities to do in the game.<br>  I remember the older games had mines you could dig in and Pokémon beauty contests you could enter. I also remember a secret base in one game which I spent a ton of time on. I enjoyed all of these extra activities and it made the game last longer. I wish the new game had more extra things like those for you to do. It just seemed like there wasn’t much else to do besides getting though the gym battles. I also was not a fan of the wild area. It felt like they were just trying to put all of the Pokémon you will find in the game in one place instead of giving you a larger game world to explore. Getting to travel to a lot of new areas and towns was one of my favorite things about the old games. The amount of area to explore seemed endless. This was not the case in Pokémon sword.<br>  If this were the first Pokémon game I ever played, I wouldn’t have any complaints.

There is some after game stuff too, and dynamaxing pokemon isn't the worst gimmick they've thought of. Overall, I had fun playing and loved the travel features so you don't have to teach pokemon useless moves anymore to swim on water or fly to another town. Super fun to play on the TV or on the go! Great for kids and for the grown up kids who have always played these games. Thanks Nintendo! I thought the graphics were great in spite of what some fans were expecting.

I’ve been an avid Pokémon fan since I was playing the original Pokémon Sapphire on the game boy, and I’ve loved every single generation up until now. Don’t get me wrong, the graphics are great (at times), the overworld is so fun to explore, and I loved the game for every second I played it. However, the one reason I don’t think this game was that great, was because it’s on the switch, yet it doesn’t truly seem to reflect that very concept. It’s capabilities as a game can be far more expansive, higher quality, and more, just like the other switch games: Breath of the Wild, the Witcher 3, and Skyrim. The storyline was also dull, and the postgame was depressing. I love Pokémon, but this just doesn’t seem to feel like what I’ve grown up playing with.<br><br>One thing I think that really caused me to lose interest was the concept of legendaries. They used to be so much more enticing and mysterious, but now they just hold such a trivial feel to them.

I did finish the entire Pokemon Let's go game and spend lots of time grinding. Kinda tedious but I pulled it through. For Pokemon Sword&amp; shield, after I got three gym badgers, I couldn't motivate myself to continue to play.  I think the name of this game should be called Lets go Pokemon Delux. Because the only difference is in the story and a big open park to capture giant pokemon. I understand that's pretty much how every generation of the pokemon game works. There is never much change in gameplay style throughout each generation. But after Pokemon lets go, I just don't want to spend so much time on doing the same things in Pokemon sword anymore. When I started the game and try to decide which starter pokemon to pick, I found the final evolution of the three starter pokemon are so damn ugly.

You seriously think most people would be able to keep transferring their old pokemon from the really early 2000s and still expect to be competitive at this time... Get over it, the times have changed. Do you really think that newcomers these days (young and old) want to try to compete on finishing a neverending Pokedex in which they need all the past games to play catch up? Stop that mentality. I'm approaching my mid 20's and I rarely have the OCD need to fill however many pokemon existing here. Games are for all ages yo. What appears good to a kid might not necessarily appeal to us veterans who have played since the Red/Blue days...<br><br>Objectively Speaking: **The MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE REVIEW**<br>The Wild Area and all the little QoL features have me hooked, and it's much more fun playing with friends/other people interested in the game. There's no absolute need to sway people from one side of the argument to the other, vice versa. Surround yourself with whomever you think has the strongest opinion and let that guide you to make this purchase or not. Graphic details are all right given that this is Pokemon... if the game became like super fine detailed, I'd swear it might go on something like the PS4 or so. Or even, it might not be the Pokemon game I've known (stopped after Gen 3, picked back up after Gen 6 with X/Y) over these years. People are just blowing this whole debate to no end, and it's childish to even keep this rant going (given that a good chunk of the audience might be adult-age by now).<br><br>I'm sure the developers by now, have heard all of your voices; just give it a rest and let the rest of us who opted to buy the game - enjoy it.<br><br>Peace out guys.</span>",People who give bad reviews blindly are themselves B A D,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHINIBHW2Q5NNUF5PBNOKKOHIFUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I didn't own a 3ds so hadn't played a pokemon game since then.  Purchased this mainly out of nostalgia and to finally get a chance to play on a big screen.  The game kept me mildly entertained through the 30 hour playthrough, but it was very easy, linear, and there seemed to be less discovery and puzzles than I remember from some of the earlier games.  This could also be the result of my tastes changing, but overall I wasn't terribly impressed.  Was not surprised to see that they are releasing DLC already that expands the world.  This feels like a portion of a game, with the full scope to be revealed through multiple future DLC...unfortunate.</span>",Pretty Vanilla,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEIAOM5O3W44NXRQI3TETOQQWTLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Pretty straight forward.  This is the first one you can play on the TV with the Nintendo Switch which was SO exciting for me. This is the newest generation of Pokemon introducing new Galar regional versions of some older Pokemon as well as completely new Pokemon.

A trend which can be very frustrating when you know its possible for the series to be so much better than it currently is.

However, when compared to other Japanese RPGS it makes you realize how much the games are still lacking. The lacking graphics feel really outdated on the Switch. Also dated is the lack of voice acting during cutscenes. The game, even with the Wild Area, is extremely linear. While these type of issues may not bother others it does for me.

Despite what you might hear, these games are not at all bad. In fact, the new gameplay elements, enhanced visuals and new designs are all up to par with what you'd expect from a Pokemon game. The biggest drawbacks are probably the story and difficulty. For the most part, battles are abnormally easy and you may only have a challenge if you don't know type advantages. EXP share is constantly on so your mons reap the benefits of battle without actually participating. All in all, not the garbage heap many make it out to be.

Many people have thrown away criticism of the game for people being upset about pokemon being missing from the game. What they didn't tell you is that most of your favorite Pokémon from LGPE cannot be transferred into SwSh. Those teams you spent a ton of time building like my Blastoise cannot be imported into the game. Imagine spending a lot of time into raising your venasaur, Blastoise, and Arbok only to find out you can't bring them into this new game.<br><br>The game is short! It'll only take your 12 hours or less to get through the entire game. The game is also very easy. Unless you're under the age of 10, this game will have very little challenge for you. Mind you Nintendo is charging $59.99 for this game. The fields are also very empty for the most part which makes the game artificially feel big. The game is mostly devoid of content so it feels like a big walking simulator.<br><br>You can no longer have your favorite Pokémon follow you or ride your Pokémon. This was so fun in Pokémon let's go. I have no idea why they removed it. It greatly reduces the immersion of the game and it's basically an easy addition considering they already did it for let's go.<br><br>There are two new mechanics in the game, Gigantamax and camping. Both of them pretty much suck. Gigantamax makes your Pokémon big. It's basically pointless since it only lasts a certain number of turns and gym leaders always use it on their last moves. This is actually worse than mega evolutions and z moves which was replaced by this mechanic. Camping is boring. It's essentially a portable Pokémon center with a dumb minigame.<br><br>Finally the graphics and bugs. I'm not going to rail on the fact they reuses models. However what I am going to rail on is the bad framerates at times (drops well below 30fps) and a lot of garbage textures. At times this game looks worse than an N64 game. What a disappointment. Next the bugs. There's these freezing bugs which could easily set you far back in terms of progress. What I don't understand is how breath of the wild has this system working perfectly, yet Pokémon managed to bungle it.<br><br>Bottom line is don't buy this game. If you're looking to get a nice Pokémon game, let's go is way better. Buy that instead.</span>",Avoid at all costs.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPMTRWHYNRVFUGI3J6PCWQ6QP2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The problem is that there could be so much more to love about this game if they just added more to it. A lot of the new features feel quaint on their own, like the Pokemon Camp, the Y-Communications, and the world you inhabit. It all just feels passionless in some cases, and with more time I feel like they could have really polished this one up and filled in all the blanks without cutting corners to make the game.</span>",I would stay away from this game if you want a complete game,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYB7DW2XXRJITPDATUCU5WENMTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Inevitably this day was going to come when there were too many Pokémon but it’s a bit of a surprise that it happened now on Nintendos first full console Pokémon release.  I will need far more hours than I already have but after spending numerous hours in Pokémon sword and Pokémon shield I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised.  I had some concerns about the game based on the gameplay I saw before release.  The story is actually pretty good so far and while it’s not incredibly deep it’s still engaging (especially for a Pokémon game).  My favorite thing to start the game that made me extremely happy was no more random encounters with a Pokémon game as they get old fast.  There are also so many great new Pokémon that you encounter right from the start of the game.  A piece of advice If you encounter a Pokémon with an exclamation point in a grassy area (hopefully I will find a shiny one soon) if might be a great rare one to catch.  The game is very accessible as well and should be very playable for new or younger Pokémon players.  The standout for me thus far is the wild area where there are tons of different high or low level Pokémon and you get to go on Max Raids.  It seems like raids are always the best part of games they are included in (it was the best part of Destiny) and this game is no exception especially when playing with real other players (instead of NPCs) with the ability to Dynamax. I assume it will become less enjoyable eventually but watching your Pokémon turn into a Godzilla like monster version of itself (for 3 turns) is great fun to battle with and against.  Also like most raids in games the loot that comes from it is pretty great.<br>All is not great however and I would be lying if I did not admit there are some issues.  I think the tough thing here is for the most part Game Freak has not really had to do much in the way of better animations and graphics when making 3DS games so perhaps complacency set in because the game definitely could be dramatically improved in both areas.  Despite what some say it does not look like a 3DS game but it doesn’t look great either.  It actually becomes more apparent when you come from playing some of the recent triple A Nintendo releases like Luigi’s Mansion 3, Astral Chain, Fire Emblem Three Houses and the list goes on.  In addition a lot of the game animations have clearly been recycled but with much better graphics than on the 3DS.  They seem like they have not even tried to do enough new animations and movements for trainers and Pokémon alike.  There also should have been a much bigger jump in graphical fidelity for a full console release.  There also could have been far more depth added to the game for its console release along with more characters in large towns.  Another negative about the game is some of the things that have been discovered by data mining like not being able to transfer Pokémon,  trade Pokémon online, and how some of the Pokémon you add will lose moves because the animations are not present in the game.<br>There are some small frame rate drops and pop In but I haven’t had tons of issues yet.<br>I do wonder if they try to add the rest of the Pokémon later when they add in other features though.  The game is fun and I think most Pokémon fans will enjoy it.  I do hope that Game Freak takes any criticism as fair and make an even better Pokémon game next time because there really is the framework of something great here.<br><br>Note:  in the game make sure to take your time to cook some curry, it’s worth it!</span>",Pokémon but you can’t catch them ALL!!!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2VX7KFESYCVHSVHSH4VFLRUI4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8
8,Mike O.,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PC7X38X/ref=zg_bs_videogames_88?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=CHXVDZJYSGRB9NGTDQJ2,Pokémon Sword - Nintendo Switch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I wish I could say that this entry was a good first step into bringing the Pokemon series into a new and more powerful console, but it's more of a hastened stumble. Before the game's release, fans of the series voiced extreme criticism over half of the total Pokemon available being made unavailable, but Gamefreak communicated that these were necessary cuts in order to improve other things in the game. Some fans didn't find that to be fair, while others waited to see what the tradeoff would bring. Now that it's out, here's what we got:<br><br>1) The Removal of the GTS: the global trading system introduced in a prior generation that made trading Pokemon online so much more simpler was removed. Instead, we're given a bare bones trading system that only allows for ""surprise"" trades and trades with people you're friends with. It's clear that they stripped all of this so that there was a reason for people to buy a Pokemon Home subscription.<br>2) Subpar Animations: the animation work done here is mediocre. Pokemon models of prior generations were clearly reused and moves are still poorly animated.<br>3) Mediocre Graphics: these graphics are not at all representative of what the Nintendo Switch is capable of. Even if the series wanted to retain its particular style, the textures could have been a lot more polished. I'd say that Pokemon Let's Go had more polished graphics than this game. The graphics here make the game feel like a ported Gamecube game that was not brushed up.<br>4) Huge Lack of Content: the game's main story is laughably bare-boned. I'll refrain from spoilers, but the story lacks a strong plot aside from just becoming a Pokemon champion. There is no ""Elite Four"" equivalent, you just re-battle improved versions of the gym leaders and your rival (who you battle WAY TOO OFTEN) at the end. There are no real side quests either. Although the addition of the Wild Area seems like a big meaty addition, it's actually not that large and made to feel even smaller by the repetitive appearances of certain species of Pokemon. The Wild Area is also almost entirely devoid of any other interaction other than Pokemon if you're not connected to the internet, and when you are, random NPC that repeat the same four lines pop in and out in a horridly animated way. There are no dungeons in this game, and routes are laughably small and hardly populated with trainers to battle. It feels as though this game has the smallest amount of trainers to battle in the series.<br>5) Huge Lack of Post-Game Content: the amount of things to do after the main storyline is finished is almost non-existent. There is a bare-boned town with a Battle Tower at the end, and maybe another hour's worth of story tied to an extra legendary Pokemon. Usually, players could invest more time into the post-game by catching more Pokemon. However, when more than half of the total Pokedex is cut, you're not just cutting people's favorite Pokemon, you're cutting a large amount of post-game content (Pokedex completion).<br><br>Overall, I'd say that the National Dex cut is the least of this game's worries. The game feels rough, unpolished, and superficial. Does that mean the game isn't enjoyable? Not exactly, and it's thanks to how reliable the basic Pokemon game formula is. What it does mean, however, is that whatever fun you do have is over *very* soon, and there isn't much incentive or content to encourage people to play it past the short storyline.<br><br>Any other series would be crucified if they had as many faults as this game does. Gamefreak should be thanking their lucky stars that relying on the brand name worked this time, and that Pokemon fans are loyal to a fault.</span>",The Pokemon Series is Resting On its Laurels,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2IXHOYZBBNNNZWT77MHZXMP6NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

But I'm totally angry with Game Freak. believe that buying products is the most direct way to support a company or brand, but not always the best way if you do want pokemon games get better and better.<br><br>When ultra sun&amp;moon were released, we understood that the little difference between sun&amp;moon and ultra sun&amp;moon was caused by the spreaded developing staff onto the pokemon project on switch platform. (Which we know is LGPE now.)<br>When LGPE were released, we also understood the poor quality of it is because it's just a first try on the new platform and short developing period. And we were pretty happy to support Game Freak so that they will have enough money or time to make a real incredible Pokemon game on the newest platform.<br>When Sword&amp;Shield released, we all see what Game Freak presented but I really cannot understand what have they did over the past year, where did they spend the money earned from Ultra Sun&amp;Moon and LGPE. I'm really tired of struggling between trusting Game Freak and being cheated by them again and again.<br>I'll ignore the deleted pokemons and mega or Z-move, because at least Game Freak gave a somehow reasonable explaination of that, including limited developing time, balance of ranking environment, and trying new concepts, though personlly I don't like the logic of these reasons. Let's go over other details.<br>1. The low quality environment texture, including the trees, the clouds in the sky, and the water that never splash when pokemons swim in it.<br>2. The mismatch between real environment and battle environment (for example fishing on wooden bridge brings you to lawn area to battle. wtf??? Or you can even see characters standing on water while the environment is water. This is not naruto lol)<br>3. Game Freak publicized that almost every room in this game can be entered. Then we discover that on some street, yes,  can enter every room, but most of them are with exactly the same upholstery. On some other streets, no, the only building that you can enter is the pokemon center. So in either case, Game Freak is cheating us.<br>4. It's 2019 now and it will be 2020 after 2 months. We can still see Zacian and Zamazenta turning around while their feets moves like moving forward. Giving a salute to MJ? We can also see that the whole world freezes except you when you are climbing on a ladder. Giving a salute to JoJo?<br><br>It's all good to love Sword&amp;Shield, but please, please, please, don't praise Game Freak saying that they did a nice job.</span>",BUYING POKEMON GAME IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT IT.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBLHRKPEOXIIYUWJYTPS7JIM5RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I unfortunately did not order my copy through amazon but I picked up my copy from a local gamestop. I haven't slept since picking it up and this is my fevered just finished the game review.<br><br>It's worse on pretty much all levels except this is a full ""3D"" experience. The music feels largely recycled with not many new numbers as well as massive graphical and technical bugs. I literally had an onix spawn into my character model in the middle of battle. The game can barely maintain 30 frames in some spaces even though the textures look like they're from the early 2000's. Reused assets and animations also means that Game Freak went back on one of their core promises. (Not a Deal Breaker but certainly worth a lot of good will.)<br><br>The amount of hand holding in the game is also nauseating. However, I did not deduct points for this as the intended audience for Pokemon games is children.<br><br>I actually like gigamax evolutions but at the cost of mega evolutions and other core features that were present in the last few titles the tradeoff wasn't worth it. The Pokemon cut from the national dex means that people with favorite Pokemon from past iterations are literally just SOL. Personally it doesn't bother me as much but one of my favorites Lopunny did get cut as a result which will ultimately affect my post-story experience.<br><br>All of these things added up makes for a very bland and uninspired experience.<br><br>I cannot in good conscience recommend this to hardcore pokemon fans and I hope Game Freak learns their lesson.</span>",Wholly Disappointed.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDERPGHG2V42AZQUQPCJUBXB6EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I was kinda surprised at how little content was in the game. The first hour was pretty entertaining and quite enjoyable however it was after this where you start seeing the problem. The pacing is not the best, I did 1 raid and had a level 30 for the first gym, and most of the promised enhancements by Game Freak don't seem to be present at all... just to name a few of my grievances with the game. Would I recommend this game to people? Yes. Would I recommend this game to people at full price? Definitely not! Double the price of any other pokemon game for less than half the content.

4,Shusaku,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PC7X38X/ref=zg_bs_videogames_88?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=CHXVDZJYSGRB9NGTDQJ2,Pokémon Sword - Nintendo Switch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I was initially skeptical of this game due to the massive number of Pokemon I regularly use being cut, but I gave it a shot anyway after being given a copy. Figured, hey, maybe there will be something that makes up for it.<br><br>On some level, this game actually shows fairly decent potential. They give access to a ton of different Pokemon early on. Also, the raids were an interesting addition that are far better executed than the nonsense of Pokemon Go. The twist with the rival toward the end (I won't spoil it) was a decent idea as well. Oh, and the Wonder Trade being done while you play the game was nice as well (though it would have been better if you didn't have to see the final animation). Seeing some Pokemon roaming around was decent as well.<br><br>Now, let's talk about the bad.<br>*The online system is a joke. You pretty much have to get lucky when you want to trade with someone specific because even when you set a link code, there's a fair chance you'll link up with someone else - my personal record is 11 attempts before getting the right person. Unlike before, where having a person's friend code actually helped, you're screwed this time around.<br>*Trying to do raids with others online is also a bit of a joke. You can try to reset the screen as much as you want, but there have been times where a friend's raid just never showed up. There's also a better than likely chance you won't connect with the random person whose raid you're trying to join as well.<br>*Ease - Why the hell do you need access to your boxes of Pokemon at all points of the game? That's just blatantly unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how much money you come across (I had over 200k before the first gym despite spending a decent bit). Heck, you get even more if you hit raids a lot. Also, lest I forget, there's the absurd amount of exp boosts you can get by doing raids due to EXP candy and Rare Candy.<br>*Not being able to catch certain Pokemon. It's extremely annoying to see a Pokemon in the wild, run up to it, and then not being able to catch it due to its level being higher than your badges allow. This also feeds into my Ease annoyance as you can use the visible Pokemon to gain quite a few levels if you know anything about strategy and typing.<br>*The big bad legendary (not the ones on the boxes) has a form you can't use. I get it, the thing has absurdly high stats, but would it really kill them to scale back its stats so that players can enjoy the other form every once in a while? There are so many ways they could have managed it, yet they chose to simply limit the players to its base form.<br>*The new gimmick, Dynamax, is a half-baked idea. Seriously, this dynamic was poorly thought out as it's basically a giant one-hit kill move. So many gyms can amount to you killing the last 3 Pokemon in one shot due to this. It's basically just a three turn Z-Move that comes with extra HP.<br>*Raids in general - While I love the idea, they executed it poorly. More often than not, you end up with completely useless compatriots if you choose to use NPCs due to lack of people joining online or whatever other reason. Then there's the issue of how many of those break out of the balls with one or less shakes.<br>*The RNG for moves is atrocious. I have had countless 100% accuracy moves miss despite there being no evasion or accuracy conditions applied to the battle.<br>*The rival story is effectively a slightly rewritten version of Sun/Moon's story. You've got a guy with a famous relative who strives to surpass him.</span>",Horrible showing,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AENDWZSR76LUHIWT5IKYVKXE3WZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This game is extremely choppy when it runs, almost to the point where its unplayable. Especially in the wild area, and especially when playing online. I am not one to notice bad graphics or bad performance in a game, but this one is just bad in that area. Again its so bad that its almost un-playable.<br><br>This game seems to oddly enough, somehow be damaging other devices. There are massive reports online of Roku TV's or Roku Devices going into a bootloop when a person tries to play this game on the TV. The only fix is to either stop playing or turn off the online play, whatever works for you. Kinda defeats the purpose of buying this game. If you have one of these devices I suggest waiting or don't buy this game at all. I have a Roku and well, I am kinda forced into owning a Roku because its one of very few devices that support my cable company's app, and I need to use the app to watch TV that I pay a very hefty fee to subscribe to. Other devices don't carry the app my provider uses. Kinda unfair for people like me who want to play this game.<br><br>This game also seems to be bricking Nintendo switch systems and corrupting SD cards. I don't know what kind of product this is to be honest, it seems to just be a bad product. I have bought every Pokemon game since the originals years ago and none have had issues like this one. I have also never seen or heard of issues like this with any video game and I have played thousands of games in my life. I also bought Pokemon Lets Go and I don't have any issues playing that game either. Clearly this product was either rushed to market or not properly manufactured.<br><br>I would avoid it and buy something else, there are Pokemon games on the 3DS system, or just buy last years Lets go, as that game doesn't have any issues that I can see or wait to see if Nintendo and Roku release updates to fix this issue before buying. Honestly I feel this product should be recalled and everyone given a refund.</span>",This game is pretty bad because it doesn't work too well,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERTWT3GCC6L4JNIC3NVBIIYZ3KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Pokemon has for years had a great story and what's better is you can connect with other players to trade or do battle but now it saddens me to say it but you want to do all that you better be able to fork up $5 a month or $20 a year. Yup And that's not the worst of it trying to connect with other players felt like a chore. I litterly couldn't connect to anyone on the wifi but this has been a issue dating back to Pokemon let's go! I miss the old fashioned way where you go online and drop off a Pokemon and tell other people what you want . Now its like game freak assume we are all born psychic and can send messages with our minds. Wow!😒 Don't get me started on the story that's the bread and butter of the game sucked. There really isn't a villian in the game like in Pokemon red and blue it's team rocket and Ruby and sapphire team Aqua and team Lava. Team shout aren't really bad guys at all! The only thing good about it is it introduce better graphics and the ability to see Pokemon run wild . I just wish you had the ability to dive I mean how cool would that be to see Pokemon underwater. And I liked the fact you get to play or bond with other Pokemon like cook Curry and camp or play with them with a cat like you but come on game freak. 😒</span>,By far the worst game ever!Update version,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFM4X6LWM7XTZORE45DGZC3DCA4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

While the game itself is fun to play and the quality of life changes are appreciated, this game feels only half finished. Between the frame drops which happen frequently while connected to wifi, the poor graphical design of the wild area, and the rather uninspired plotline this game pales in comparison to previous installments even from just the last generation. The map feels incredibly small in this game. The wild area was a step in the right direction but it needs work in terms of pacing as you could spend hours in the wild area but there’s little to nothing at all to keep you in the cities. There’s no side minigames or real subplots to motivate you to explore like in Sun and Moon where you could take on missions and character interactions regularly brought you back to the city. This game needed more time, more attention and more care. I loved the designs of the pokemon this time around and the selection was superb, however a stellar new roster does not compensate for the lack of content and attention to detail. Gamefreak can do much better than this. I know they can because I’ve seen their great storytelling in action. However, this game almost feels like a throw away cash grab just to placate fans for another year. Please Gamefreak do not fall into the same trap as activision with Call of Duty. Take your time, finish the game.

However, I do believe a lot of the people who gave negative reviews either didn't play the game to its fullest, did not play the game at all, or gave a negative review just for the sake of giving a negative review.<br><br>I have been a Pokemon fan since Red/Blue/Green first came out, so as more generations were revealed and I grew, I became highly critical of certain things Pokemon was doing. When the marketing for this game came out, I was extremely skeptical of Dynamaxing, thinking it was just another Raid function from Pokemon GO, or the Pokemon designed were pathetic compared to Pokemon of the past.<br><br>With that said, I got Shield first and ended up going back to the store to get Sword because I was enjoying Shield so far. You can tell Nintendo and Pokemon were really working on the overall background of Galar, its animations, and the entire League. Not only do you no longer receive your starter from the Professor (now from the Champion, brother to Hop, your rival), your character will have to be endorsed to enter the League - which is a smart move background wise. The animations are great and I grew to love a majority of the characters.<br><br>The Pokemon of the region match the region they're from, from the Grass/Dragon types Applin, Flapple, and Appletun, to the Fairy types living in the Glimwood Tangle.

Not Nintendo, nor Game Freak, nor the Pokemon Company have commented on this fact, that Nintendo Switch systems are LITERALLY DYING because of this game, not to mention the fact that it has the potential to corrupt your SD card, forcing you to redownload all of your games (People with slow internet, beware), and can actually get Roku TVs stuck in a bootloop.

This is by far the absolute worst. Many people say, ""it's for kids"", but that is true of all of them, and this one is definitely the worst. Not only have they removed a significant number of Pokemon, they haven't added any interesting ones. The map is incredibly small, compared to other games and very straightforward. It's just heading directly to one gym after another, with no real adventure or side quests. The wild is a nice touch, but doesn't make up for all of the shortcomings. The game is pathetically easy and unlike all the others, it holds your hand the entire time. And yes, it could have and should have been bigger and better, and should have included all the Pokemon. Yes the Nintendo switch can handle that kind of game. It can play Skyrim, so I don't want to hear anything about how Pokemon couldn't have been a better game. They didn't even bother to really update the animations from 3DS. Don't waste your money on this pathetic installment. I'll never buy a game from game freak again.

Ponyta is no longer fire but... psychic?), you get the town map in the menu option, you're reminded where to go in the menu if you forget, you start with an old rod, tons of pokemon right off the bat in the wild area, rumble in the controllers that make the dynamaxing engaging, need I say more? If youre into competitive, this is a good game. I'm no competitive pro but this game make it simple to learn the curve. New to pokemon? This is a great place to start. As you pick up items you're briefed on the information. Your hand is almost held as you're battling if you don't yet understand type advantages. The reminders and town map in the menu are key, too.

Game feels fun but very limited. For people who have never encountered Pokemon then they will love it, for everyone who has a history they will probably dislike it. I think the criticisms are justified. My biggest problem is the lack of late game (12 hours in was Final Battle) content. Unless you're going to hunt shinys or something grindy there isn't much to do at all. Most the game feels re-used and the pluses are just minor tweaks that should have been addressed generations ago. Content is pretty stingy considering all GF has to do is add 3d models and some basic animations. It's not like they changed the game to take advantage of a new system or anything it is the same old game boy framework.<br><br>Maybe it is just me but I felt a little ripped off with lack of new content.

That said, it's also the least innovative of any of the Pokemon games. I've been a fan since 1998, I own every Pokemon Game that Gamefreak has released, and after this spectacular failure I will not be buying Pokemon pre-order (or potentially any other Pokemon game) going forward.<br><br>While all other Nintendo IPs have spent the time re-writing game engines and remaking or putting serious polish and vision in their assets, Pokemon contends itself to make money producing the same. The Pokemon have next to no new animations and the graphical quality is far below its peers. It does not fight for play time against Animal Crossing New Horizons, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Xenoblade Chronicles, Super Mario Odyssey, the list goes on.<br><br>If you don't care about graphics, let's get to game function. My first ten minutes the game crashed and froze during very simple cut scenes (the one getting Pokedex). The game slows considerably when inside the Wild Area with internet connection on. The UI and connectivity settings of trading makes it nearly impossible to trade 5 Pokemon back and forth in a row with a friend- I have yet to be successful with that. When you try to join a raid ongoing, you have to click twice to try and ""check"" before getting denied after a minute's wait. This comes up constantly online. If you attempt to do raids offline, you will lose any and every raid that 5star because of how badly they programmed your assisting NPCs.<br><br>This game has improved certain quality of life elements as every new installment, but its not nearly enough. The game costs $60, twice as much, yet for the first time in their history the game has no post game content. Instead, you have to pay for a DLC coming out later for it. The DLC looks mighty unimpressive and was advertised in a way to trick kids into thinking they have to buy it in order to receive their old Pokemon. Whether that was their intention or not is beside the point.<br><br>The story is incredibly bland and full of poor follow-through, as if the team developing the game was disjointed. Leon starts off as a very encouraging Champion but by the end he acts like a sore loser, especially if he doesn't have a crowd to ham on. Hop's entire character arc is slashed in the last cut scene of the game where he abandons everything he's learned up until this point and decides to become a Pokemon Professor. The concept of Pokemon Professor is not redefined within dialog of the game, merely, he came up with the idea that they go around and help people and he decided that was the title to do with. Much of the supporting cast have good motivations and excellent designs, but GameFreak also had a cut back in the number of those kinds of unique trainers too as we no longer have an Elite Four or other reoccurring ""npc"" to appear such as Mohn in Sun &amp; Moon, etc.<br><br>I beat the game is very little time and dabbled in making a team, which as mentioned with quality of life changes, is easier than ever before. But I found everything to be a chore, it didn't matter if I didn't have to grind to reach level 100 because it was easily handed to me. I spent more time trying to connect to a raid battle than I actually spent doing raid battles. I did easy shiny hunting which was very successful with a shiny Dreepy in 38 eggs, but I decided afterward that putting rubber bands on my Switch to get shiny Pokemon was kind of a pointless experience. This game has killed my love of Pokemon.<br><br>This franchise will go on, probably successfully, doing the same tired thing over and over and making money because there is always a child out there who has never experienced Pokemon and which everything is fresh. But with so much excellent competition, this game is a waste of energy and time I could be playing- anything else.<br><br>I would return this game had I not bought it off of Pokemon Center online.</span>",The most disappointing Nintendo IP Switch release,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGTHHO7YXVRI3S2NOXUQJXOBHLJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Cities/Towns are pretty, some were too small though.. The Wild Area concept &amp; raids were a nice addition. But still feels weak compared to other RPGs environments.

This game takes a proven concept to the level that fans have always dreamed of!  The new wild area, where you can see pokemon in the grass, is brilliant!  There are still a few mysterious encounters where you can't see the pokemon ahead of time, but those encounters can be avoided if you know what you are looking for.  Stronger pokemon roam the areas, and can be battled but gym badges are required to catch the higher level mons.  At first, you hate this feature.  If it's there, why can't I catch it? but the reality is that this limit keeps the game fun.  If you managed to catch something level 35 or 40 early on, it would potentially make the game too easy/boring.<br><br>No more HM's!  Brilliant!  You no longer have to keep pokemon you don't want just so you can cut bushes or  smash rocks etc.  This is the most streamline and fluid pokemon game I have ever played.  Gone are the days where the only thing keeping you from a gym is a dumb bush you can't cut.  In sword and shield it is always clear where you need to go, and you progress through the game in a very natural way.<br><br>Gameplay:  I love the battle animations.  Some have critiqued them for not being 100% consistent and not showing up in a few surprising places, but for me, they add so much!  A lot of moves have very specific animations unique to each pokemon.  I love it!  the replay value is huge because battles are no where near as boring as they used to be.<br><br>Graphics:  okay, they are not mindblowing graphics considering all the games out in 2020, BUT for pokemon, these graphics are great!  Lots of beautiful things to look at, but my fav is seeing the strong pokemon walking around in the wild area.

If you will be mad that they don't have your favorite first gen or second gen pokemon etc, then yeah, maybe this title isn't for you.  If you are someone who likes pokemon in general and will appreciate all the huge upgrades from the gameboy games, well in that case, you can not go wrong with this title.  The story unfolds in a beautiful and fun way.  This game keeps you engaged and greets you with beautiful mechanics and graphics.  So many old frustrations are gone and I personally think this is the best installment we have ever seen!

There are a lot of interesting ideas like camping, cooking, and the wild area that have potential but are not quite there yet due to what feels like features that were cut or just straight up missing. I wont talk about the cut pokemon because everyone has already done that.<br><br>Raid battles are fun but be warned if you do not have the online pass for the switch, the in-game trainers for the raid battles are W O R T H L E S S. The npcs will either bring unevolved pokemon or just stuff that will get crushed by the raid pokemon. Nothing hurts more than fighting a 5 star G-Max snorlax and one of your allies is rocking a magicarp.<br><br>The game story is... VERY unfinished to say the least. You spend 90% of your time battling through the gyms to become the champion which is pretty fun but then near the end of that you are suddenly thrown this half-baked scenario where you have to stop an evil pokemon A from destroying the world with little to no backstory on ANYTHING beforehand outside of the occasional ""sword and shield hero stopped the darkest day"".<br><br>There seems to be quite a bit to do at the endgame, if you want a good Ditto after you beat the game story go to the nursery in the wild area and then straight north of it along that same wall there is a raid den, use wishing stars on it till you see a purple light and you have a ditto. The star rating will tell you how many perfect IVs it will have. You can EV train your mons by sending them to a 24 hour seminar for the stat you want WITH the corresponding power band. May want to use vitamins instead if you want more specific levels in multiple stats. If you have the g-max meowth get it to 100, give it the amulet coin or luck incense and enter the champion cup with it in the lead of your party. G-max it every battle and just use g-max gold rush. You will pick up 99,999 coins every win and 24,000 something from the trainer themselves.<br><br>Anyways overall not a bad game but definitely not a finished game, the next versions of sword and shield will hopefully include what feels like is missing and have a more rounded and solid story to go with it.

Every time i get a pop up to join one, it's always to late. Late as in, it'll finally show on my feed to join and i'll click to join, but the battle is already over! But nothing is still worst then how freakin easy it is. It's the reason why I'm losing interest in playing. There's no challenge. Yes, there's raid battles, but that gets boring after the 10-20th time. One of the problem to why it's so easy is the wild area. It has so many strong pokemon, that gaining level is way to easy and fast. You can go from lvl 10 to lvl 45 within 30mins - 1hr. The main problem is how under level everyone is, especially the gym leaders. How has GameFreak not yet implemented lvl scaling or just a HARD mode?

For years I’ve dreamt of a full-scale, open world, triple A, big screen, big budget, surrounded sound, ass on the couch, Pokemon experience. For Sword and Shield, I purposely chose to ignore all the press as I wanted to go in blind and enjoy a pure, unbiased experience.

For me, Sword and Shield had potential to be the best Pokemon game of all time. Like no one ever was. The unfortunate reality is, it represents the first watered-down, lazy, copy paste, main-line entry in the Pokémon series. This game is agonizingly easy; anyone with an ounce of Poké experience under their belt will be woefully over-prepared. Any trainer who houses an ounce of intelligence inside their skull or takes small pleasure in their sense of efficiency will find their brain continually moving into a sleepy state because there is literally no challenge. Most Pokemon games are a normal, balanced difficulty. In my opinion, S/M (I've heard X/Y too) started to bring the franchise down to easy mode, but this game brings us right down to beginner mode. As many have said, it’s literally “Baby’s First Pokemon”.<br><br>The hand-holding is so abundant, so aggressive that as a seasoned trainer I felt mentally insulted and exploratorily oppressed. Any sense of excitement and exploration is gone as the game forcibly babies you along every painful step of the way. They told me to go to town to find the train station. Hop waited on the trail for me to remind me. When I reached town, the game took over and showed a cut scene literally panning in on the train station. It's simply too much, were they targeting a 4-year old audience? Do they realize that a masive fan base exists amounts all age groups? I mean, I'm not looking for Grand Theft Pokemon but please give me at least the Pixar treatment. Let me have a little adult fun! The dialogue is so basic and unrealistic. It’s OK to have cut scenes but this game has long moments of characters just standing around, talking about nonsense, and saying nothing interesting. No change of view, creative angle, etc. Just same camera view, sitting there, ready to go to sleep.<br><br>Back to basics can be a legit strategy but it only works if everything you do actually put in the game is of utmost quality and depth. GameFreak pulled a crap sauce combo where they dumbed down the entire game even more so and the elements we love that they did leave intact, are for the most part, poorly done. This game takes accessibility to a disgusting level and partially destroys the essence of the game itself by doing so.<br><br>I hate writing this review, but I feel so ripped off. I can’t believe I paid full price for this game. Never again will I reserve a game or go in blind and trust that the developer will get it right. Pokemon is so popular and high selling, these developers could literally work with unlimited budget. Imagine what this game could have been if it were given an extra two years, more money, technology, and talent. There are developers with a micro fraction of the amount of resources that Nintendo/Pokemon/GameFreak has who put out vastly better games. This is simply inexcusable. I cannot help but feel like this entry was a slimy cash grab and they are laughing all the way to the bank. You've been warned :)</span>",Buying this game perpetuates corporate greed. Truly a lazy outing for the developer.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAGCBEADACJKCUNGXKD7XRGOSEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I do a fair amount of random encounters, fight all trainers in new areas, and even with the mandatory EXP share I am a couple levels lower than the trainers I come up against. You can't do a lot of grinding, but that's not how I like to play Pokemon anyway.<br><br>I watched 3 reviews before buying this game. I loved X and Y, hated Sun and Moon, and I need to get my two cents in. This is not the perfect epitome of pokemon we've all been dreaming of since pokemon Stadium on N64. It IS a very enjoyable fresh adventure with good immersion and IMO great new pokemon designs. Dynamax I could care less and have no opinion on. I prefer classic battle styles.<br><br>Pros:<br>+Pokemon out in the world. Gyarados chilling in the lake. Great world immersion.<br>+Wow they nailed the gym challenge. It really feels like a football-level spectator sport.<br>+Character and pokemon designs are great. I actually want to catch em all, and evolve them to see what they become.<br>+The style and color palette for the world are great. It's a pretty game along the lines of Breath of the Wild.<br><br>Cons:<br>-What is with some of the textures in this game? It's like at the last minute Gamefreak realized it's not optimized, so they cut a load of corners. Some of the textures are grainy, as though they've been stretched wrong. N64 level graphics. It's pretty few and far between, but really. They know better.<br>-Draw distance is pretty short (see: optimization). Doesn't bother me, but it may bother you.<br>-They cut a bunch of the pokedex probably for optimization reasons. I own Nintendo's online pokebox cloud, I have all my faves stored. I don't really see the issue here. Is it disappointing? Yes. Does it ruin the game? I really don't think so. If all I do all the time is play my faves, I may as well go back to X and Y.<br>-EXP SHARE IS MANDATORY. Game loses a whole star for this. What the heck. As if pokemon isn't easy enough already. Do any battles or camping or anything, and your team will be over leveled in the next town. My workaround for this is just to keep swapping out my team with lower level pokemon, and that's actually been really enjoyable. But I shouldn't be forced to play like this for some kind of challenge.<br><br>All in all, I still love this game. It's simple, mostly beautiful, and how much you like it will really depend on how all the cons weigh with your play style. I would price it worth $40 new, not $60.  I am looking extremely forward to the next installment where hopefully Gamefreak has learned how to properly design for the Switch.</span>","I've been around since Gen 1, and I'm thoroughly enjoying this game.

I'm not usually the type of player to buy both versions but I have been absolutely smitten by these titles. The wild area is fantastic and introduces so true MMO elements. The pokemon feel alive and vibrant; camping is a treat that introduces lovely animations for every mon, old and new. And for those who are into competitive PVP play, it's never been easier to get a competitive team together thanks to nature modifying items, an easy to grind battle tower, and the ability to get high IV dittos with minimum effort for breeding.<br><br>And the storyline is an absolute treat. I think as far as ingame play goes, this is my favorite story since Hoenn. The characters are likeable and 3 dimensional, and they really improved on the handholding aspect by allowing you to skip the usual tutorial bits early game.

So for the majority of the game I was just HOPING I would catch or ""evolve"" a Pokemon that would ""look"" cool.

Also, uncovering of the story of the darkest day as you go along is like solving a crime. Three, being able to see the Pokémon in the grass simulates being there. Finally, having the gyms be a region-wide competition adds a competitive feel to the game. Cons: beating the gyms is a kind of easy if you catch an advantaged type Pokémon. (Example: if the next gym is a dragon gym, and you grind to get an ice type). There also is less Pokémon than in other titles. The storyline is a little crazy.

Despite not having a complete National Dex, there was still a great verity of Pokémon to catch and build a balanced team with. The characters, and story weren't all that bad either. It's a really good Pokémon game. The big issue with the game is that everything felt extremely linear. Going from gym to gym had a VERY set path, and there wasn't much room to explore around the world freely (other than the wild area). The linearity nearly ruined my experience. The routes felt really small as well, only adding to the frustration of feeling boxed in. The other issue I had was that you can't turn off experience share, and every Pokémon leveled up extremely fast. It would of been nice to have that option to turn EX Share off for harder playthroughs. If your a fan of Pokémon, I would highly recommend Sword/Shield.

You don't have to hate this game just because tons of people do, you can have as much fun as you want with it as long as you don't ignore the glaring flaws (sketchy animation quality, lack of animations despite the promise of there being new ones, 30$ DLC less than a few months after release that could've just been included with the base game if they took a bit more time to program the damn thing, ect.) in the end I feel my first score of 4/10 was unjust and due to fun factor I will increase my score for this game to a solid 6/10.

She’s been obsessed with the franchise ever since.<br><br>Sword and Shield is a different entry into the series. Instead of a top-down, closed path game, you’re presented with a wide open world to explore, catch pokemon, and take on trainer battles.<br><br>It’s big, brightly colored, and just lovely to run around and experience. One of the biggest annoyances with “Let’s Go” was the pace of movement, and just getting around felt like a chore. Travel in Sword/Shield feels much better, and the freedom of movement and not being locked out of paths is great.<br><br>Everything else about the game follows the same basic Pokemon gameplay: catch pokemon, train them up, and battle other trainers.<br><br>There’s been some controversy about the size the pokedex (the amount of pokemon in-game), but as a more casual fan/player, there’s not really much to say. I’m sure it will be a big deal for hardcore fans, but they will still sink 100+ hours into this game.<br><br>Differences from Pokemon Shield:<br>As with most pokemon games it’s broken up into two difference versions, each with very minor exclusive pokemon included. Honestly, very few people will care which they get. The game is exactly the same with a couple minor differences. According to other sources here they are:<br><br>Sword exclusive pokemon:<br>Deino, Zweilous, Hydreigon, Jangmo-o, Hakamo-o, Kommo-o, Gothita, Gothorita, Gothitelle, Rufflet, Braviary, Mawile, Solrock, Passimian, Turtonator, Galarian Sirfetch’d, Galarian Darmanitan, Galarian Darumaka, Flapple<br><br>Shield exclusive pokemon:<br>Larvitar, Pupitar, Tyranitar, Goomy, Sliggoo, Goodra, Solosis, Duosion, Reuniclus, Vullaby, Mandibuzz, Sableye, Lunatone, Oranguru, Drampa, Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Rapidash, Glaraian Corsola, Cursola, and Appleton<br><br>There’s also supposed to be a difference in some of the gym leaders, and potentially in which Legendary Pokemon are featured, but these are minor, and only the most hardcore fans are going to care either way which they get. Obviously I haven’t caught them all, but if the above is important to you, make sure you pick the right version!</span>","Sword is an absolutely wonderful experience: big, bright, playful, and fun!",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKKKGCSWQR5TKJPAFPLHF7VT26Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Instead, far more content was removed from previous games than actually added in this one. The supposed reason for the cut content and price increase was the increase in graphics quality, but the game runs poorly and the animations are limited.

You can't bring over all of your Pokemon from previous games, and you have to pay for another service to import the few that were included.</span>",Not Worth $60 USD,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYAGF3Q2G55CHDFIOMKWTJL2ACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This is what I imagine Pokémon on a home console should be, but in these games it is limited to one area that’s more or less separate from the main route you travel on your adventure. An interesting component of this zone is the max raid battles, which were inspired directly from Pokémon GO. I do not like the forced multiplayer in PGO, but in this game I was happy to learn you do not need multiple players the game will spawn NPCs to help you.<br><br>It’s too soon to tell what they may do with this game going forward, but I think the lack of DLC is a huge miss. These two games, unlike their 3DS/NDS/GB counterparts, do not contain programming for every existing Pokémon. Meaning the creatures that can’t be caught in these two games, can’t even be traded from previous games. Knowing Pokémon their resolution to this will be to keep making games, presumably $60 a piece $120 for both versions like these. I just feel with the higher price of a switch game compared to the 3DS this is going to become much less practical.<br><br>3/5. I’m not overly bothered with the lack of so many Pokémon, it’s disappointing with their track record, but in general the game has a lot of fun elements to it. The part that I find the most disappointing is the setup being basically the 3DS game running at a higher resolution with higher fidelity assets. I didn’t expect a “breath of the wild” for Pokémon, but aside from art assets they aren’t taking advantage of the increased power they have from the 3DS. If the next Pokémon game on switch doesn’t massively overhaul the formula I probably won’t buy it, but that’s only coming after I have played the newest games and realize there’s more they could do and they played it a little too safe here.</span>","It’s Pokémon, just on switch",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFYO52LD6R63RPXTAQ6AMWP7HBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The Wild Area is just scratching the surface of what the future is of Pokemon and has our family excited.  Graphics wise the game looks beautiful and some of the new animations are really breath taking.  Only complaint really is the control changes between the Routes and Wild Area.

I watched videos on YouTube and decided to purchase for my 12-year-old son along with the Switch console.  I am usually a very meticulous buyer, but this time I made a slight mistake.  Whilst looking for the cheapest price, I purchased the UK version.  This was completely my error.  I was dismayed at first, but then became excited that I had an import!!!  So, if you are an American who purchased by mistake and are having buyer's remorse.......DON'T!  This is no different from the North American release.  Do you speak English?  Yup, methinks you are good to go then.  Now, I haven't opened the game yet, but I think my rating will stand unless there is no game inside. lol  Not kidding!  Also..I researched DLC info for you.  It seems numerous people have bought games from different regions and were still able to purchase DLCs from their regions without any problems.  The Switch seems to care more about your System language than a specific region that speaks said language.  Example.....buy the Japanese version of this game.  Since it supportsw English, and your System language is English too......you can download any future DLC from any English speaking region.  Oh yeah......game came in two days, mint condition, etc.  Again...I just need to open it.  If there's no game...i'll be cranky. lol</span>",Mario Mario's Most Excellent Adventure,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLDHYD2NZOSD6HB6YF6Z3G65IXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Most missions use Cappy's ability to become enemies and such to overcome the puzzle-like environments. Cappy can also be controller by Player 2.<br>The art is very crisp and colorful and each world's themes are focused and interesting. Objectives are diverse and often challenging. The game can be very easy to pick up as a new player, yet there is a layer of complexity that invites hardcore players to pull off some calculated acrobatics and maneuvers. There are also references and sections of the game that anyone that grew up with Mario will enjoy.<br>The story is reminiscent of Pixar shorts and takes Mario's cast of characters through different large worlds to rescue the princess yet again. There are familiar faces, moves, and items throughout, but the experience as a whole feels fresh and focused.<br>This game is perfect on the go, as you can pop into the game and reach goals in a matter of minutes since there is so much to collect. I felt compelled to stick to the main story of the game although there was plenty to do on the side.<br>I highly recommend this game if you have a Nintendo Switch, especially if you've ever enjoyed any of Mario's previous games.</span>",Must-Have Switch Game,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGWTC2TYEQ7XBYF7EMK3OCG5S3HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This is the best game since Mario 64 by far. We’ve had all of the different systems throughout the years and I’ve played lots of games but I’ve always loved Super Mario 64, it’s stayed in the back of my mind as one of my favorite games and when we bought the switch I thought I would try to see if this has anything similar and after reading the reviews on amazon and people saying it was like that- I had to have it, but I had my doubts.. amazon didn’t have it at that time, but target had a sale and only two left so I had my husband run to get it. It is what I’ve been waiting for and more!!! It has been the most fun that I’ve had with a game in years!!!!!!! Every chance I get I play. The makers put SOO much detail into every piece of it. It’s amazingly nostalgic but new and  innovative, I honestly just can’t get enough of it. I never want it to end honestly. If you loved the original Mario platform you will not be disappointed, they mixed that in too. I just had to get on and write a review for this as this game deserves the five stars by far and that’s the only way for me to say a thank you to the makers!!!!!

Taking cues from all its predecessors, Super Mario Odyssey is a gorgeous platformer with plenty to do, almost to its detriment. It’s clear a lot of attention to detail went into this game, but it’s also evident that Odyssey is a celebration of Mario’s history as Nintendo’s de facto mascot. The fact that you can now play as many of Mario’s enemies is a fantastic mechanic that is as unique as it is timeless.<br><br>Odyssey uses the improved graphics on the Switch to create stunning worlds that are just itching to be explored. The music as well is perhaps some of the best in the franchise, with the theme to the Wooded Kingdom being my absolute favorite. Additionally, while I usually like to play with a pro controller, Odyssey’s advanced motion controls (likely inherited from the Galaxy games) give Mario that much more mobility and versatility. The diversity of the different worlds was also a welcome change from the more streamlined beach- and space-themed levels from Sunshine and Galaxy, hearkening back to a style reminiscent of Super Mario 64.<br><br>While I do appreciate that I can pick up the game at any time and find a few moons that I missed the first time around, the massive amount of collectibles didn’t urge me to fully complete the game. Sure, there are some expensive costumes that I’d like to get eventually, but the amount of effort to find everything—including earning some quite difficult power moons—pushed me away to play other games. After all, once I explored each of the different worlds to satisfy my curiosity, the game had not much more to incentivize me to play past the post-Bowser credits.<br><br>A fun gameplay mechanic with plenty (almost too much) to explore, I give Super Mario Odyssey 4.0 stars out of 5.</span>",A fun gameplay mechanic with plenty (almost too much) to explore.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPKTKAUAD3ZVLH4NEGWTLQJGV6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

After beating the game and collecting 800+ moons, I still want to go back for more.  I want to find the last few things I need to capture, get the last few purple coins in each kingdom, buy all the items and clothing, get all the moons in each kingdom.  I'm easily 50 hours in and it's the only game I want to play when I turn on the Switch.  My other games have been untouched for several weeks.  The controls are good, Cappy is a wonderful fresh addition to the Mario series, and there are many hours of wonderful new entertainment packed into this game.</span>",An instant classic and must have for Switch owners,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7AUXNONECBHZAJYWDGAK4BDF5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This game is one of my favorites. It’s reminiscent of Mario 64, but unique enough to feel like a totally different experience. There is enough material on the game to keep you entertained for weeks. I love that the game has objectives that are open to the player AFTER bowser is defeated. This open game play is my favorite. I love traveling through levels again with brand new challenges and objectives. Well worth the price tag.

The new hat mechanic was cool, the various jumping options made moving from place to place a lot more like parkour, and the first world has a lot of great detail that makes it interesting to experience at every point.<br><br>Unfortunately, the only other world that bears that level of detail is New Donk City and the hat mechanic quickly grows stale. Using parkour to move around the few places on levels that require movement grows tedious, and attempting to walk carefully is nearly impossible given how imprecise Mario's walk/run/stop movements are (he feels slippery, somehow, in a way that adds more frustration to the game than it adds to the experience of puzzles).<br><br>Everything but the uneven aesthetic would be excusable if the movement-based puzzles were frequent, varied, and complex. They are not. They are scattered lightly throughout the large, mainly empty levels. Often the solutions are obvious or require only a short amount of consideration-- and once you have solved a few of the puzzles they quickly become trivial.<br><br>I aired these grievances on reddit when the game first came out, and was told that the ""real game"" begins once you have completed the main storyline. By that time, however, I was bored with the puzzles, bored with the aesthetic, and ready to sell my game to someone else.</span>","Large, candy-colored, empty worlds to jump around in",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2PYU5KUGQ442IP6P3KAHA5SVXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Sometimes moons are so easy or so random to get... you can stumble upon one without even trying.<br><br>However, despite this, I can't emphasize how much I enjoyed the game.

Needless to say, my son doesn't want to play and now his 31 year old father has been playing home run derby non-stop in an attempt to unlock the games he wants to play... Now, I don't really mind this to much as I am a gamer and well, home run derby is pretty sweet, however 2k should have really had an option allowing parents to just simply unlock games so your kid can just play what they want to play without the hassle of going through hours of H.R.D.<br><br>Regardless, I can see this game being a 4 star game ONCE the games are unlocked, its a shame that so far no games make use of the built in technology like Wii Bowling... this is more just press the x button and move the joystick... simple enough for kids, but hey, rolling your wrist forwards or backwards isn't exactly ""complex""....<br><br>Parents, be prepared  for some home run derby to unlock the games your children actually want to play.

We got the game because my five year old wanted to play ski-ball. That was locked, so we had to grind games we didn't like to earn 150 tickets to unlock ski-ball. Motion controls also locked until a high score in each game is earned.<br><br>Only found a couple of games that are fun to play.

Most talking about having to unlock motion controls or various games. The old one made you unlock games too so I thought eh that's not that big of a deal. It gives me some kind of goal. And heck for $20 how bad could it be right?<br><br>Well, the graphics are terrible for a game originally sold at $50. The controls and UI are confusing. The games are very basic (not like some of the delightfully difficult games in the original). There are no special game versions like the old one. When you play split screen games, it does a full four-way split even if you're playing with AIs, so it's hard to see. It's slow to load everything. The algorithm for earning tickets is all over the place. You may earn 40 tickets for first place or you may earn 3. And once you do unlock all the games (it took us less than an hour) there's no real goal to work towards other than some weird outfit items. Oh and the games aren't real carnival games. Most are just weird made up mini games with a carnival vibe.<br><br>Unless this game drops to like $10 do not buy it.</span>",Trust me.

We were very excited to see it on the Switch, but after we bought it, it is disappointingly boring. You have to play to unlock motion control features, which seems very lame.

I almost did not  buy game because of  that complaint. Imagine my surprise when it took me all of 45 minutes of play  to unlock all the games. I played each of the unlocked games like 4 times and had earned enough tickets to unlock the remaining games and I suck at gaming.<br><br>The games are a mix of silly games and fun games with a few really good games.  It is a good mix that will entertain children and  pass some time for adults. Up to 4 players can play each game and if you play alone you play against 3 AIs at you choice of easy, medium and hard. once you unlock all the games, use can use your tickets to unlock customizations for you game character avatar.

The new Carnival Games is very similar - it's a shallow mini game collection in which you need to unlock just about everything, making it one of the most annoying games that I own.<br><br>The first unlockable is clothing customization, which is just fine.  Earn tickets to trade in for silly hats?  No problem.  Options are quite limited, but this is the kind of unlockable I can get behind.<br><br>After that, though, almost everything in this game is hidden behind a wall of requiring ""tickets"" earned through game play.  You start with only a few games, and need to unlock more as you go.  It's fairly easy to play the few games one or two times apiece to earn the 75 tickets needed to unlock bowling, but it takes 2,000 to open other games, and that's going to take ages.<br><br>Motion controls, one of the calling cards of the genre, are not enabled by default, but need to be unlocked with high scores in each individual game.  Despite the Switch's improved Joycon controls, motion controls are still an imperfect slog, and need to be calibrated before every game.  It's also impossible for one player to use them while others use joystick controls - it's all or nothing.<br><br>The games themselves range from OK to terrible.  Admittedly, I have not unlocked them all, but Skeeball and Cup toss are pretty good, as is Ring Toss, albeit long.  The bowling game looks fun until you realize how easy it is - my seven year old was regularly scoring 250+ in only five replays with joystick controls.  The baseball game is equally shallow, with few options and repetitive, slow swinging that allows you to hit home runs with ease, motion controls or not.  The drone racing game has terrible graphics and worse controls.<br><br>Overall, this is not a recommeded purchase, except maybe for very small children.</span>",Too Many Unlocks,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEA2MA24WNQT4JM3R3RK6QTE45YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I brought it to a family gathering and I'll be bringing it to our holiday gatherings. I was hoping for more of a remake of the Wii game, but it's a new game with worse mini games. Super Mario Party has a ton better games. Since most of these are mindless button mashers, it is easier for kids to jump into this without knowing much.<br><br>A big problem is that to get to the point where it's just a fun game that everyone can enjoy, you have unlock everything. It takes quite a bit of play to unlock everything! For another crazy thing, you have to unlock motion controls! At first you only have button controls. For the younger audience, motion controls should be the default!<br><br>Most of the games aren't great. Even the better games are turned into button mashing competition because you have unlimited balls. Many of them aren't carnival games. Even the carnival games aren't great versions of it. The good side is that the games are simple games that are easy for young kids to pick up. If I put Super Mario Party in front of kids who aren't gamers, we have to explain and practice every game. Here kids can pick up the games much quicker and spend more time playing than explaining.<br><br>It has it's place as a mini game collection with a very low learning curve. Once everything is unlocked, it's not horrible. Even with everything unlocked, it's not great. But we don't have a lot of mini-game collections on the Switch. Put this in front of a pile of kids and they'll have fun. I just wish it was a remake or expanded version of the original Wii game instead of this new poorer quality game.</span>",the Wii version was a lot better,

It was a sleeper hit whose sales were spread by word of mouth rather than by reviews. It was a good tech demo for the game ala Wii Sports and was a lot of fun, especially at parties or in group sessions. Even now, a lot of gamers look back on the original Carnival Games with nostalgia. Heck. Unfortunately the two follow ups, Carnival Games Mini Golf and New Carnival Games were no were as successful, in terms of sales or popularity and so it's not really a surprise that the brand skipped the Wii U altogether. Of course, nearly EVERYTHING skipped the Wii U, but that's a tale for another day.<br><br>I was happily surprised to see Take2 was bringing back Carnival Games as a Switch title. However, to say that Take2's releases for the Switch so far have been lackluster is an understatement. Don't even get me started on their WWE '18 game and how it deserved all those ""Worst Game of the Year"" awards. However, the Civ 6 port to the Switch was fabulous and so I decided to give this game the benefit of the doubt (and a hearty dose of nostalgia) and give this a go.<br><br>Was I disappointed? Yes and no. There are 20 possible mini games in this release, but only 8 are unlocked from the start. You have to use tickets to unlock the other games, which I didn't have a problem with as they are easy to come by. After an hour of playing, I had unlocked all but one game, so I don't understand all the whining about need the tickets to unlock the games. It's not like they are hard to come by,.<br><br>What I didn't like was the quality of the games. like any mini game compilation, the quality is all over the place. No one is going to love all the games in a compilation, whether it's Raving Rabbids, Mario Party or You Don't Know Jack. The good news is, that with 20 games to peruse, there is something for everyone. I loved games like the Haunted House Ride, the Home Run game, Ring Toss, Speed Bowling,  Cup Toss and more. These aren't the ""real names"" of the games, but they're more helpful for you the reader to know what the game actually IS. I HATED the pig racing and a few others had spotty controls that were annoying, but there was nothing that made me swear at the futility of it all like Catherine on the hardest difficulty.<br><br>There were only two issues that I really had with the game. The first is that motion controls are locked until you get a high score, which seems odd to me considering the motion controls were what made the franchise a hit in the first place.  Instead you're stuck playing the game with a normal controller. This is fine, but makes the game a shadow of what it would be if the motion controls were available from the start.<br><br>The second is that all games are four player games only. So you can't just practice by yourself to learn the game, frame rate (what can I say, I grew up on SNK fighters) and other aspects of the game. Instead, due to the constant competition, you always feel rushed. In the original Carnival Games for the Wii, this wasn't an issue. You could just run around and play all the games solo. I really wish this was the case here.<br><br>Overall, I'm happy with what is here. It's enjoyable, but not great by any means. This was fun for an hour to uinlock everything, but I have no interest in achievements or collecting tickets to unlock music or outfits.I could care less what my Avatar for this game looks like. I would definitely play several of these game again, and certainly would have friends give them a try, but the end product is nowhere as good as the original Carnival Games.<br><br>If you can pick this up for $19.99 - this is worth grabbing, especially if you're a big multiplayer gamer. Otherwise, you can probably pass on this. Younger games or those that really liked Wii Sports will get more out of this than someone who primarily plays Call of Duty or point and click adventure games. Still, this is the best the franchise has looked in over a decade, so that's a positive to focus on.</span>",Not as good as the original Wii game by the same name - but still fun for what it is.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH25KZPVYZTS7RYASUSZ6UQ5L6XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

At first I thought perhaps 1-2 Switch was, but this feels more like ""Wii Sports"".  Shame they didn't think to include this with the console.<br><br>Anyway, this is a fun party game, mostly geared towards younger kids.  I'm 53, and I don't fit that, but some of them are still fun to play.  I got a kick out of the bowling game, myself (again, Wii Sports).<br><br>As others have said, it is annoying though that you can't just play all of them from the start.  When your 9 year old wants to play one of the locked titles, it's not easy to tell them ""no, you can't"".  That part of it is not good, but as the games go, they're fun little games here.  Just don't expect Call of Duty type graphics and gameplay here, and you're good to go.<br><br>I knew going in the games weren't much more than mini games, so my expectations were properly set.  The fact that you have to unlock them lost a couple of stars, IMO.</span>",The games themselves are basic fun - but the unlocking part is annoying,

Some of the new games are real nice and well thought out.  The cosmic bowling manages a full game of bowling with typical scoring, but squeeze it well into a mini-game. The ghost hunt is really well done as well, as is the homerun derby.<br><br>The initial problems of unlocking games has been updated and removed. Unlocking motion control (an off thing to have to unlock) can be done via relatively achievable high scores in respective games.<br><br>The problem is the game is still a collection of just 16 mini-games, and it will get repetitive pretty quickly.  This issue is remediated by getting it on sale and having younger kids to play it as the title will quickly start getting dust as an adult multi-gamer.</span>",Four stars but with asterisks,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXWPY6MM4SMHJZFOBOVJZT6UOLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Nintendo has always had great party style games (Wii Sports, Mario Kart, Mario Party, etc.), however it is important to note this is NOT an official Nintendo first-party game.  It is designed by 2K studio.  That didn't immediately turn me off as I've played some pretty awesome 3rd party games that were great (Fusion Frenzy for XBOX for example).<br><br>Once played, I immediately noticed a drop in quality.  The music sounds like a cheap mobile app game.  The graphics similar.  Upon initial playing, only two games in each category are unlocked and you'll need to progress through those games before you're able to unlock the other games.  What's also weird, is Nintendo has always been about using motion controls (Wii Sports), but this game you press the A button and use the control stick...so not innovative.  All the games feel uninspired and controls are clunky.  Even after unlocking games I thought were going to be fun, they all seemed the same.  Very poor quality!  I was highly disappointed in this game, and so was my wife.  We were excited initially to take it over to play after our family's Thanksgiving meal, but decided to leave it home because it was so anti-climatic.  I think even younger kids will get bored quickly with this game.  A definite swing and a miss game.</span>",Basic and not a lot of fun. Games feel clunky and uninspired.

Right?<br><br>Well, take that redemption center and put it on its head.  What if you had to earn the tickets not for dollar store junk, but you were instead earning tickets just to be able to move your way through the arcade?<br><br>Well, thats how Carnival Games works, and its a major deviation from the product description.  If we were only buying clothes that would be great.  But the tickets let you unlock new games.<br><br>There are games where you enjoy the ""grind"" but Carnival games should not be one of them.  The grind is like how you will play a game repeatedly to get better or level up.  I'm not completely opposed to the concept.

While that can happen, it was met almost immediately by questions about why you can't play all of the modes and games and a lack of patience and understanding on the part of the younger possible users (as well as my spouse, and even my daughter who made some disparaging comments about how the unlock process functions).  In the end, the games may be entertaining, but having to unlock everything is too time consuming, at least initially, and just plain boring for the user that sits and plays through enough to complete that task.<br>Rather than wasting too much time with this cartridge (bundle of minigames) the potential users were much happier to instead switch to something else that they could more quickly play and enjoy.<br>2 begrudging stars, and would be 1.5 if that was possible.</span>","Disappointing... too much like work, not enough fun",

Don’t waste your money!! All of the somewhat decent games are locked and you need to earn tickets to unlock them. Most games give you less than 20 tickets and some games cost 700-1000 tickets to unlock! That means you have to play the lame games a billion times to unlock one half way decent game. The graphics are awful, it looks like a game you’d see on the original Wii at best. I thought this game would be like Wii sports where you swing a controller to bowl, etc. nope. Not at all. You just push a button. How is this not a 3rd party game?!

The reason you want to play those unlockable games is because you're getting bored with the other minigames and you want something different. But no! You have to keep playing the same dull games over and over.<br><br>That said, my six-year-old likes this game, the minigames are easy enough for him to do, and his screen time is limited so he hasn't gotten bored with it yet.<br><br>Controls aren't great. At least they're consistent across the minigames, but aiming and press+hold for distance isn't a great control scheme. You can unlock motion controls if you get a high enough score, but those aren't great, either.</span>","A lot of grinding, gets old quick",

I am a noob and it took a lot of work, looking online, youtube videos, and going through the menus to try to figure out what the game was even about, how to win, etc.  It also does a pretty poor job of tutorials and the menus aren't very intuitive.  There are a lot of confusing mechanics and options in the menu and the translation to english in the tutorials seems like there is something lost in translation.<br> Additionally, I got it for a party tonight, excited that there would be 74 fighters as advertised, but only 8 are available.  Fighters are randomly unlocked by playing the game for hours.  You might unlock 2 in 1 hour or play for 4 and unlock none.  Plus you have no control of who gets unlocked.  Excited to play as Snake or Bayonetta?  Good luck.  Literally.  Unlocking them is just random luck.  Kind of a shame for people that just want this as a party game and don't want to put in all the effort and time to unlock all the characters that were alluded to being available.

278,Michael,https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N5OKGLH/ref=zg_bs_videogames_62?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=CHXVDZJYSGRB9NGTDQJ2,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>My preorder from another store came Thursday afternoon, so I've been playing with my kids for about eight hours. It totally lives up to expectations. It's in no way perfect, but there's just so much good that I don't see how anybody can be sad. It's a game I'm going to be playing for years, and I'm going to enjoy it for years. If you're a parent, your kids will love playing with all their friends. If you're a returning player, all the nostalgia and great Smash gameplay is here. If you're new to Smash, this is a great game to play with other people.<br><br>When you first boot up, you'll have access to eight characters: Mario, DK, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Starfox, and Pikachu. Unlocks happen pretty quick, but we'll see how long it takes to unlock all 74 characters. I love some of the new costumes like the Mario Wedding costume. I read an online unlock guide that said if you quit the game after unlocking a character and play another quick round that you'll unlock lots of characters quickly. When I say quit the game I mean to exit the game on the Switch home menu. That's worked well so I did that for a while on my Switch to unlock quickly so I could play with lots of characters. I didn't tell my kids about this because I want unlocking on their Switch to be more organic and slower.<br><br>Lots of characters have pretty big differences in how they play and lots of characters have small differences and lots is the same. I don't even know what to tell you. Switching out pokemon with pokemon trainer is really fast. You can detonate Link's bombs remotely. The basic gameplay is the same so Smash fans will pick up on things really fast. I still think that Smash is the best game for fighting game beginners because the controls are very simple.<br><br>Gameplay is faster than the past few games. This can make battles more crazy. The only complaint about faster gameplay is that it's harder to keep up with both your character and everything else that's happening on the board. I've lost my character a number of times. I almost wish we could get an option for colored outlines for all the characters. I might just be out of practice, so we'll see if this is still an issue after a while.<br><br>Is it balanced? There are 74 characters--who knows! And since Smash for Wii U had balancing updates, this will be different in a year from now. I will say that the kids and I have fought with all sorts of characters and nobody's thought that any seemed overpowered. We're just barely starting to see the changes to characters and how new characters work and we're still unlocking characters. The Smash community will be finding things out for months and opinions are going to change over and over.<br><br>I love that you can save rulesets. You can customize the game heavily with more or less stuff. You can have lots of items or no items or specific items or more lives or change the Final Smash options. It's really cool to have all your quick pick favorites but at the same time making rulesets is a little slow. I feel that as I get rulesets made that I'll really like it. Today being new, I've really wanted to make a tweak between games and it's been kinda slow because of all the options available. We are a two switch family and it's going to be a pain to make all our rulesets twice. I really wish there was some way to bring rulesets with you.<br><br>I don't know how it could be done better, but the stage select is just one big picture of little tiny squares. It's almost too much. I wish there were an option to show you like 12 random stages rather than all of them. We've mostly played on random so far because it's overwhelming!<br><br>The graphics and animation takes a step up from the Wii U more than I thought it would. The stage graphics are awesome and there are so many new touches that are really cool. The N64 stages feel updated but classic. It runs very smoothly in tv mode and we've not played in handheld mode.<br><br>The music is awesome. There's just so much variety. It all sounds like it's made on a computer, but it's all really good music. I hear there are over 800 tracks...<br><br>Controls feel great. The joycons aren't the perfect smash controller. The thumbsticks can't keep up with a good player. The pro controller is better, but the gamecube controller just feels right. Maybe I'm nostalgic, but I'm really enjoying playing with the gamecube adapter. My daughters prefer the joycon because that's really the controller they know. My 11 year old son also likes the gamecube controllers (but I guess he could be feeding of my choice). If you're really serious about the game, I really suggest your getting the gamecube adapter. Mine that came with Super Smash Bros Wii U works great, but I see they're selling it separate now. It sold out quite a few times in the Wii U era, so you might want to pick one up now!<br><br>Local multiplayer is awesome. I think you can play with 8 players on every stage. We've had five people playing lots of battles and it's been a whole lot of fun. This is Smash Bros to us!<br><br>We don't play online, so I'm just ignoring that. I'm sure lots of people will be talking about how crappy it is or laggy or great or amazing or horrible. We play with family, with friends, with church youth, and with anyone around a TV.<br><br>World of light is the single player story mode. My first impression is that it's not as good as Sub-Space Emissary from Smash Brawl, but it looks like a decent way to play alone and unlock more stuff. Kinda like I don't play online, I don't play the story mode that much. My son is excited about it, so I'm glad it's here. I'll just let others who want story mode more review it better. Collecting spirits to affect your character and the stage seems really cool, but I hear that it just means that the uniqueness of the stages go away so all the stages seem the same. You will run into stages with fog. If you have a spirit badge that takes away fog, it just makes it another normal Smash battle. We'll see how fast it gets old for my son.<br><br>They've said there will paid and free DLC. Piranha Plant will be free DLC for early adopters and will be available early next year. There will be 5 paid DLC packs that each has 1 new fighter, one new stage, and music tracks. The first one will be a Persona 5 character! They haven't announced any others yet. These packs will be six dollars each or 25 for the set. They haven't set a date for the DLC but they've said all 5 packs will be available by 2020. I assume one will come every few months.<br><br>Overall, it's an awesome game. With the free Piranha Plant, you get 75 fighters to pick from. There are over 100 stages. There's just so much Smash. It plays great and it's a lot of fun. I totally suggest this!</span>",How will they ever top this game?,

The biggest flaw is online which was a big selling point. It is AWFUL, Nintendo do still had not learned how to make a decent online game and is about 14 years behind everyone else, the bad coding mixed with horrible input lag makes the game sluggish. Why am I forced to pay for an online subscription when the game connects of a p2p  network and every match is filled with lag to the point where it is not even enjoyable. Not to mention when you set your settings for 1v1 preferred matches you never get what you want and are then put into FFA lagfests. You can go to the arena mode but all that is just a waiting in line simulator when you have more than  2 people in a room. Why can you not switch your characters after a match?

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>If you've played Smash Bros. since you got the n64 version, this game shows just how much the game has evolved. I am no means a ""pro"" when it comes to playing Smash Bros. but this game is the best I have played since it's first iteration.<br><br>Let this be a disclaimer for all the people who have never played a Smash Bros game before, this game is overwhelming and taking it all in is a task within itself. Look at it this way, you bought a Tesla on the sheer fact that it's an electric car, only to find it has so many features you have to read a manual, but when you finally grasp the aspects of the car the reward is tremendous! So my advise to you is to take in each feature, one by one, and indulge in each of it's aspects. What you will find is a deep and enriching gaming experience that captures what Nintendo is all about, and at the same time you will learn how to truly Smash... your opponent into oblivion.<br><br>Like most Smash Bros. enthusiast I loved melee, and deemed it the best of the the series as Brawl ruined my favorite character (fox) and other aspects of what Smash Bros is, but when the Wii U version came out, I loved that game because it was released on the 3DS and I can play Smash Bros. where ever I want when I want and it has an interesting mix of melee and brawl. Now we have Smash Bros. Ultimate and it's on the switch, it's portable like the 3DS version, it looks amazing graphically, and it leans more towards Melee in terms of its gameplay and speed but not so much that it's hard to pick up and play. In other words, it's has the best aspects of the series in a amazing package and did I mention that the switch makes it portable :).<br><br>In short, this game is a must have. There is 100's of hours of game play in a small cartridge and is worth your time to invest. Again, if you don't have time, it's portable so you can indulge when ever and where ever you want in what could possibly be, the best switch game yet!</span>",Truly Ultimate... if you take your time with the game.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXBIN6EANWB54I5WXZ6Q63THM2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8
75,Jordan,https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N5OKGLH/ref=zg_bs_videogames_62?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=CHXVDZJYSGRB9NGTDQJ2,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,4.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the ""Ultimate"" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word ""ultimate"" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.<br><br>Part 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The ""how to play"" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.<br><br>Part 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long.  And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br><br>Part 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard ""Smash"" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called ""squad strike"" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a ""squad"" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode ""special"" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have ""Spirits mode"", which houses this game's campaign mode, ""World of Light"". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting ""trophies"" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of ""Spirits mode"" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters.  So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you ""equip"" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember ""stickers"", which are  almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of ""spirits"" is fully brought into play in the ""World of Light"" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named ""Galeem"" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you ""skill points"" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the  ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with ""World of Light"" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters  make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in ""Smash mode"". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have ""Classic Mode"", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the ""classic"" modes we're used to. And by ""different"", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were ""break the targets"" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over.  And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.<br><br>**SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the ""For fun"" and ""For Glory"" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.<br><br>Part 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like ""Break the Targets"", ""board the platforms"" and ""Home run contest"" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like ""All-star"" and ""event match"" are absent.<br>UPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via  an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.<br><br>Lastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the ""World of Light"" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.<br><br>Part 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,""break the targets"" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, ""Classic"" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.</span>",A well-crafted fighting game that still packs a punch,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHACEDQMP46KC75JLAHRLUMBNI5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Amazon delivered mine at 9:30am release day with me waiting around the door like a giddy teen girl for her date. I have been awaiting this game more than any other ever since buying a switch. I was hooked right from the opening cinematic which showcases what makes this series so magical to its fans. So many familiar faces from the past 4 decades of gaming as either playable fighters or cameo appearances. All the nostalgia from seeing so many old ""friends"" gives me the feels... As soon as my wife gets from from her appointment, she joins in. This is her first Smash game and she is seeing what all the hype is about. At 3pm when the 13yo son and 6yo daughter, they both join in. Hours go by with us unlocking new characters and taking turns trying everyone out. We are all jumping out of our chairs/sofa and screaming when someone defeats a challenger and unlocks them for play, clamoring to be the first one to try them out. This game is so much fun, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who had a hand in its creation. The stages are more amazing than ever. The amount of content is staggering,so many items and temporary allies/Pokemon! Whether you have friends or family to play this with, or you are playing solo you owe it to yourself to try this if you have a Switch or are considering getting one. 10/10</span>",Ultimate Family Fun!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGN7BMMIOHU6EYHNBNW4DSL3EB4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>To get started this review will be aimed towards veterans, I will not be explaining what SSB is or how to play it. I will only go over what is different this time around so hold on to your seat. First things first, Here’s a pro tip for any Meta Knight mains, I need you to scroll to the top of the page, close Amazon and go back to For Honor where you obviously main Orochi (pls give Like if you got the joke) but really though. The first thing you want to do is go right into spirits mode, because you only get 8 or so characters to start. Any character you unlock in spirits mode will automatically join you in regular smash, however any character you unlock by triggering the “A new challenger appears” fight, will not be added to spirts. The best way I can describe this mode is a mix between Pokemon and Mario party, you and your opponents can equip spirits (that have replaced trophies) that can give you boosts like, improved jumps, stronger attacks, fire resistance, etc. And the ultimate goal is to equip spirits that counter your opponent’s. Although once you have your favorites leveled up enough it’s possible to just tank your way throughout most of the battles. Except for a few annoying ones. And get comfortable because this mode took me 15 hours to complete with only a 80% completion rate. I suggest you tough it out because the final act really makes the grind worth it.<br><br>The entire Game has received minor graphical upgrades, as for the fighters themselves, all have obtained animation tweaks that give them more personality overall, Mario has a cooler down smash, Zelda has a new costume and can now throw energy beams with his sword at full health (A little inside joke for the Nintendo vets) Every part of the game really makes it feel like they put they’re heart and soul into it. The amount of content packed in here is astounding. Even the settings/rules you’re allowed to play with can be overwhelming at times, but don’t worry, you can save and name your custom rules so you can get back into the action quicker. Also be sure to take advantage of the ability to pick 2 stages and morph between them. Home run contest and target practice are gone, Because they had to save space somehow. But Here’s the real tragedy. I think all of us veterans know that picking the right color makes us play better, and some alternative colors where cut. Are they really expecting us Mario mains to go online and fight those Malakas Meta Knight mains without his fire flower outfit?! (AC fans where you at?) in all seriousness though, this game is a love letter too all the Smash fans that have been with this franchise throughout the years. Do yourself a favor. Buy this game and good luck online.<br> If you enjoyed this review be sure to like, comment, and subscribe!<br><br>Update; So they added 2 new DLC characters, Piranha Plant and Joker from Persona 5. Look up gsmVoiD to get in-depth look at both characters. And be sure to use P Plant’s neutral Special attack on opponents trying to get back on the stage if you like cultivating salt in amounts that the world has never seen.

Beyond that, the fun stops.  There are a number of World of Light fights that I'm pretty sure were never actually tested.  They're completely unfun, and you spend your time praying for good RNG or broken AI instead of actually fighting.  The online matchmaking is awful, and you're often put into rulesets you didn't ask for.  And the overall character balance leaves a bit to be desired.  Great that you included so many characters in the game, but you're essentially throwing all hopes of ever balancing it out the window.

There is just so much content in this game that I can already see myself having 100+ hours in it. I'm making this review because there was some concerns that I read in some other reviews and I want to point out some things.<br><br>There was a review that talked about how you start off with 8 characters and how it was not advertised above. Although I cannot confirm the second statement as I did not read it, starting with 8 characters is true. The truth is, this game's 72 characters are unlocked every 10 minutes which if you do the math means a seriously long time. How to fix this? Play a match with 20 minutes facing any CPU on any stage with a lot of room. Once done you should see a new challenger. Beat them and exit out the game. Re-enter in the game and play again only this time with one live and self destruct at the start of a match. You should get another challenger. Rinse and repeat until you get all the characters and if it doesnt pop up anymore, redo the first method and follow the same progress. I have used this method and unlocked 53 characters and I could have done more if my switch didnt die or I wanted to eat. (I searched and found that I only played this game for 6 hours in my profile).<br><br>One review said that it doesnt teach you how to play the game which is completely 1000000% false. When you enter in the game on the smash ultimate logo, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING.

If you are complaining here without even doing your research then clearly you arent doing your homework.<br><br>I recommend watching a Youtuber called ""Zerowondering"" who was ranked the best player in Smash Wii U/3DS and posts videos on how to do ""this and that"" in Ultimate.

With every character that has been in all the previous games back and this one, plus a good number of newcomers, and with more on the way in the form of DLC. Many quality of life changes have made this more accessible to beginners while also helping you train to get better to reach a more competitive level.

Ultimate,3.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>This is the first time I’ve ever played any version of Super Smash bro's. It’s loud, it’s flashy, it has great music, but has no instructions $^!*@#^!! I spent the first 15 minutes just trying to open a battle, then got destroyed for the next 30 minutes while I helplessly mashed any key I could. One hour and 10+ Google searches later, I was just trying to figure out how to open training mode. Was there a training mode? Thankfully yes. There is a training mode hidden here in a place you wouldn't think to look.<br><br>After another hour trying to figure out how to do moves (the game only gives you instructions 5 moves.) The rest you kind of have to figure out on your own. I still have no idea how the spirits are used (are they just aura buffs?) and how much each level improves my character? Where are the stats? Why are there 2 spirits? Are there other special moves not listed on those 5 moves? Where can I find them? I use game suggested spirits because there is no darn manual to explain! Why can my damage go above 100%? How do I do a “final smash?” What the heck is a “final smash?” Why does Kirby change after eating an opponent? How do I revert back? What is the buff he gets? It is incredibly frustrating for first time players. I played fighting all my life and this is the first I’ve had so much trouble with.<br><br>I gifted a copy of the game to my 8-year old nephew on Wednesday, and called me crying in frustration this morning letting me know he still can’t figure out how to get past the initial menus screens.<br><br>I feel Nintendo let their ""new players"" with a short rope, banking all the ""veteran players"" who knew the game would know what to do. What about the rest of us? The game play looks fun, but there are no instruction on how to reach that level of knowledge to enjoy it at its full potential. I bought a 3rd copy for Christmas for my other nephew, but thinking of returning it. I seldom play and just wanted to enjoy myself. I don't feel like spending hours just to try and figure out moves on Adventure Mode to be able to enjoy a game which should already come with instructions?</span>",First time playing - No instructions included - Hard to figure out,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDB5BN45VL2ZBSNXLEBKICCQQJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,3.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Pros:<br>+ Large roster of 75 fighters at launch.<br>+ Huge list of 103 stages.<br>+ ENORMOUS catalog of music. The audio in this game is INSANE! I've never seen a game with so much musical variety on top of all new voice acting and sound effects.<br>+ Many franchises represented with fighters, stages, music, spirits, and challenges. Where else can you throw a Pokeball at Mario and Sonic while playing as Samus on a stage resembling Midgar?<br>+ Chrom, Incineroar, and King K. Rool are excellent picks for new characters. There are other new characters.<br>+ Very fun to play with a lot of friends! 8 player Smash on a projection screen is still a blast!<br>+ Multiple control options. Use Joy-Cons, Pro Controllers, or Gamecube controllers.<br>+ Everyone can play Smash Bros. Adults, kids, and even non-gamers can play the game. Easy to learn; difficult to master.<br>+ Very flexible fight system. Deep customization options for player handicaps, fighter balancing, stage hazard control, item frequency, teams, and more. More options than previous games.<br><br>In-Betweens:<br>o All fighters can now be unlocked thanks to patch 1.2. Previously it was near-impossible for a non-competitive or casual player to unlock all the fighters due to super-aggressive AI.<br>o Online play is smooth and tries to respect your preferences. Prior to patch 1.2, the online was laggy and would put you in matches you didn't want to play.<br>o Nintendo seems very disconnected from their players. They don't seem to be able to interact with casual Smash fans without sending the hyper-competitive group into a meltdown.<br><br>Cons:<br>- ""Everyone is here"" is not actually true! Charizard is not a standalone fighter anymore and has been tied back to Pokemon Trainer. Nintendo really should release a patch that gives the option to play Charizard standalone again. Being forced over to Squirtle upon KO is a problem. The competitive player argument that Charizard was always intended to be part of Pokemon trainer does not satisfy the casual crowd. It was fun to play standalone Charizard! Nintendo, please fix!<br>- Gatekeeping online community of hyper-competitive players who care more about tier lists and frames than fun. Very difficult to get Nintendo to pay attention to genuine problems when the elite players are constantly screaming for nerfs and more difficulty while suppressing everyone else.<br>- Starting roster is only the original 8 fighters from the N64 days. You must unlock 67 other fighters. Ridiculous! Takes a long time to unlock all fighters even when using workarounds. Not acceptable in a full priced game.<br>- Adventure mode is highly repetitive. It could have used some side-scrolling, beat-em-up levels like mini-Subspace Emissary or Smash Run experiences. It can take a long time to unlock new fighters in adventure mode.<br>- Some features are missing. No stage builder, home run contest, target smash, and some other classics. Not a huge loss, but still curiously absent staples of the franchise.<br>- Online system does a terrible job of separating competitive players from casual players.<br>- No Miiverse doodle fun.<br><br>I've owned every Smash game since the original N64 game. Smash can be a fun game to play with your friends if everyone chills out. Smash Ultimate feels like a step forward in some ways, and a step back in other ways. At launch, Smash Ultimate felt too focused on the competitive players. After patch 1.2, Nintendo has made some adjustments for the casual crowd and earned a star. The jury is still out as to if Smash Ultimate is more about fun or more about competition. I need to see some of the cons addressed before I increase the star rating for this product again. Good game, but could be so much more!</span>","Everyone is here...eventually, sort of",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFQST5EM3QOBXDLAJVWL7AULAMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,2.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>It was a lot different than I thought and that's in a bad way. First impression was the interface. The menu screen and the rest of the selection menus are incredibly dull-looking and honestly just ugly. It's grrat that it's easy to navigate, but I was a little let down on the interface. Secondly, online play is laggy, huge disappointment, sometimes nearly unplayable. I did not have this issue for brawl. Thirdly, we're severely limited in character selection for online play. This definitely applies to co-op mode online (not sure with single player) teams, but in order to change your character, you have to exit out and quit playing with the same opponents? Again this wasn't the case with brawl. This is such a stupid hassle and I don't understand why Nintendo would even do this. Also I would like to have the option to play with multiplayer mode online with friends. It's ridiculous how it's only single player and my siblings can't join in on the fun for battle arena. Moving on, World of Light was fun for the first 10 minutes, then I realized how repetitive and boring it was, epecially with the lack of a promising story. Attempting to obtain 4* through spirit battle are nearly impossible--it's pure luck if you win, but you'll be bummed if you miss your shot trying to ""steal and awaken"" the spirit from the statue.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I'm not a competitive player so I picked the characters I enjoyed the most of Smash History.<br><br>This is my Top 10 Favorite Super Smash Bros Fighters of all time.<br><br>10. Sonic the Hedgehog<br><br>Back in Brawl, I was excited to play as him when I unlocked the character, He may be bad at launching opponents like Young Link, but I played a lot of his games since then. I don't play as him as much in newer games. But I like to play as him once a while.<br><br>9. Joker (Persona 5)<br><br>I loved Persona 5 back when I played it. I was kinda supprised when Joker was announced as a first DLC fighter, Once I played as Joker, He has all the attacks from his game, like pistols and grapple hooks. I also liked that his Persona Arcene comes out when his gauge gets full, His attacks are powered and his recovery are better, Arcene won't last long in battle, but he's a fighter he won't be reckon with from his past criminal record.<br><br>8. Dr. Mario<br><br>I liked regular Mario, but I'm not fan of this FLUDD attack from Sunshine. So he was brought back in Smash 4, I still like his attacks are more tougher than Mario's, He may lack in recovery. I still prefer over Mario for his down special spining attack tornado.<br><br>7. Toon Link<br><br>Link and Young Link are good fighters, but I always play as him since I unlocked him in Brawl. I like he jumps higher, and he's quick as Young Link, I was fan of his Cartoony Appearence from Wind Waker, A lot of people didn't liked it back in the day. I still play as him over other Links.<br><br>6.Rosalina and Luma<br><br>I was kinda supprised when they decided to bring Rosalina to Smash 4, I liked her attacks like the Luma, You can control both Luma and Rosalina at the same time, I also like she can have her Luma defend her from attacks. Her attacks may be nerfed in Ultimate, I still play has her.<br><br>5. Byleth<br><br>I was supprised I started to play as the character more than I expected, I was kinda not too crazy when a another Fire Emblem character come to Ultimate, I was impressed of his or her moves, like the Powerfull Bow, Spear and Axe, Atttacks may be slow, But I like the Grapple Hook Recovery, There's a male version, but I mostly play a female version of her thanks of her pleasant appearence.<br><br>4. Ice Climbers<br><br>I was kinda bummed when they removed the duo in Smash 4 beacause of techinal limitations of the 3DS Hardware, I glad they were brought back in Ultimate, Their attacks are changed, I played them in Melee and Brawl. Not beacause of their broken imfamous ferocious chain grab attacks, I liked you can control both Popo and Nana at the same time, your probably supprised I had them on this list.<br><br>3. Princess Peach<br><br>Okay, I love to play as her in every Smash Bros games since Melee, She may be nerfed in Brawl, but she got slightly better in later games, Her Parasol Recovery is great, I liked how she floats with her elegant dress, I know I'm a guy playing as a Pretty Pink Princess, I also like to throw veggies at opponents as well, I love her feminine charms to take out opponents with her slap and her Heart Bomber.<br><br>2. Ness<br><br>My boy Ness has been around since Smash Bros 64 as a unlockable fighter, I was fan of his original game Earthbound. I like how he floats, He has PK attacks to take out opponents, like the PK Thunder to recover himself. I played as him in almost every games in the entire franchise.<br><br>1. Kirby<br><br>Kirby is one of my favorite characters of all time, He may be bad in most games, but I liked is copy ability like swallowing his opponents to use their attacks, I like he hovers to recover, and I like how he sounds in most game, just so adorable, I play almost every games just like Ness. Just knock his opponents out with a hammer just like King Dedede. He also great for combos like kicking.</span>",This review has my favorite fighters of all time from all generations of Smash.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6KSM42SARIFX45TXPNFJVMAOUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Pros:<br>The World of Light adventure mode is fantastic. Not only is it really fun to play with the addition of a progression system with the spirits, skill tree, and unlocking more fighters, but it also quite long and will take you many hours to fully play through. I actually quite enjoyed the spirit system and the many different spirit fights seem diverse enough that it doesn't really start to bore me. Maybe the only problem is the varied difficulty of fights. Most fights are insanely easy after you have a decent full leveled spirit, even on the highest difficulty, but you can always purposefully handicap yourself by using a weaker spirit if that's your thing.  But also some of the fights were so insanely difficult and unfair that switching down to ""easy"" mode still made the fight take me 30 minutes of replaying to beat (and I'm pretty decent at the game).  Honestly it wasn't even a downside for me I enjoyed the challenge and it wasn't a necessary fight for progressing.<br>Huge character pool this time around. ""Everyone is here!"" Not an exaggeration over 80 characters will be on the roster after dlc and counting Pokemon trainer as multiple fighters.  Obviously some of those are just slightly different echo fighters, but the diversity is still great.  Just quick unlocking characters by restarting, unlocking, and restarting again took a long time. All the characters look great and feel great to play and play vs, though I haven't  been able to use all of the extensively yet.<br>I'm not a pro player by any stretch, but the fighting mechanics feel fluid and the engine seems well polished.  I love that the heavy characters have been buffed by having their lag time for aerials and landing reduced. I like them making perfect shield harder/different as it will give pros something to develop skill wise as well. Hopefully the pro scene will be able to make something of this game as smash 4 was a bit of a let down (won't even talk about brawl).<br>They also made training mode better, and allow you to play the game while waiting for an online match, but many other parts of online are less than desirable.<br><br>Cons:<br>Online mode is kind of taking a back seat here. I was really hoping we would be getting a more fine tuned and more competition oriented online mode, but got the opposite. They made online mode a for fun system, which I understand is the direction Sakurai wants to take with the game, but I just don't understand why they couldn't have given their competitive community a bone here. Online match making no longer has a For Glory mode. There is simply casual mode with a matchmaking system that puts you up against someone near your skill level based on an elo system on a per fighter basis. It also matches you with some with a game rule similar to your own, but not exact.... this has made me go into what I thought was a 1v1 no items match into an assist trophy free for all nightmare.  This is also going to continue to create debates as to what the ""official"" competitive rule set  will be for  1v1 online play.<br><br>Overall the game is a great experience and was definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait. Tons of replayablity and fun for all levels of players.</span>","Amazing Adventure Mode, Huge Character Pool, and Great Mechanics",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG75GJ3BBBSTNUD4W5TV64K5OAPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>It's good for the fact that it has all the characters from previous versions and some new ones as well, but has some flaws too. The 'story' mode, World of Light, is further from a Brawl-like Subspace Emissary adventure, and more of a boring slog through a seemingly endless line of one-on-one fights. The cutscenes are few and far between, and the spirit system is more cumbersome than enjoyable. The changed battle mechanics are a bit of a step down from Smash 4 in my opinion, although everyone will have their own opinion on this. With all that said, this game has the most to enjoy out of any smash game, including all the battle modes, characters,  and stages. There are simple tweaks that make the game more enjoyable, such as the ability to set different and default rule sets, the Pokemon-style party battle, the variation in classic modes, stagemorph, controlling stage hazards, final smash meter, the big scoreboard, and more. If you enjoy Smash as a multiplayer experience instead of a single player one, this game is a must-have.</span>",Smash that buy button,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFAQ6P3J22UYWBZAMX4VX74BZCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This is easily the only reason I bought a Nintendo Switch initially (I recently received a few Switch games for Christmas as well).<br><br>The game is incredibly fun.  The Adventure mode takes you around a huge map where you collect 'spirits' that aid you in battle while you unlock your main fighting characters who have been trapped by evil.

You will definitely get your money's worth.<br><br>There's also a 'spirit' mode where you just conduct battles to gather spirits.  They cycle out every 5 minutes or so.  It's great to collect any spirits you've missed as last I checked, there's over 1,200 in the game and there's been updates to continually add more.<br><br>Smash Online is fun to battle in multiplayer.  There's different settings you can do from lives, items, maps, etc. that you can set so you're placed in a game that you want to be in.  My biggest complaint with online play though is that the servers are extremely laggy.  If one person in the match has a bad connection / slow internet / etc, then everyone suffers with lag and stuttering.  I am not sure if this is a Nintendo server issue or a Brawl server issue, but its pretty frustrating.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I've been playing Smash Bros. since the N64 days and it's been great watching the evolution of the franchise. There have been stepbacks, especially with Brawl, but each iteration brings something new and unique to the playing field. Smash Ultimate is more than that as it brings most of everything from all Smash games and THEN some.<br><br>Technically, this game is gorgeous to play on a big screen and portable mode and 99.9% of the time, runs at a stable 60fps. Lag inputs are somewhat of an issue compared to older titles, but it's something I've gotten used to (still hoping for a patch).<br>Speaking of input, the mechanics of this title are fluid and tight with each character feeling unique in their own movesets. There are so many characters to choose from and the promise of even more is mindblowing. It's almost impossible to buy this game, play it, and not find a character you stick to.<br>But the real star of this show are the gamemodes, specifically the Adventure mode. World of Light has some great battles and good challenges for those looking for one, but it's extremely lengthy. My 100% playthrough of the adventure mode on hard clocked in at over 40 hours. Of course, your mileage may vary, but expect a long time grinding. Other modes, like classic and multi-man smash are also great fun, with challenges encouraging you to pull off some crazy, insane feats.<br>But, when it comes down to just playing Smash by yourself or friends, this is the ULTIMATE package. I haven't tried the online yet, so I don't have an opinion on that, though I have heard some negatives. Either way, your $60 or whatever price you pay will not be wasted, rest assured.<br><br>This is not just a Switch essential, it's a reason to BUY a Switch.</span>","My Favorite Smash Bros, Bar None",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCIYYZRW4NADMF2QSHTPTNOSELQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,2.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>The latency in this game made it a trashfire for me personally. Yeah I'm coming from a melee background. And if you tell me I'm spoiled I'll tell you that things should get better not worse and you're the reason searching for a movie on amazon and netflix sucks. Because scrolling to a file in an alphabetically list and clicking it which takes 2 seconds was somehow, to you, less preferable than taking 7 minutes to get your tv remote to painstakingly land on Twilight on your streaming services when you were actually trying for Titanic. Admit it, the Apple spearheaded gaudy-square ui that infects everything now was more preferable to your lazy narcissism than selecting from simple raw data and that's why we're all doomed. That's why capitalism is allowed to take away user's right to easily perform maintenance on their own devices. They distracted you with an Idiocracy level ui where you can push pretty buttons and you gave up the entire logic center of your brain with no complaint.<br><br>ANYWAY I have beef with a bunch of Ultimate.  Here's a main one: Screwing with the screen in 50 different ways during play is not a game mechanic. It's bad game design and there's no way to avoid it in the single player. You limit who you play with when you have to set flags for ""yeah stop putting an insulting giant dog graphic over the screen when people are playing and calling it a feature."" Single player is especially heinous with this crap.<br><br>Online is toxic of course.  People just troll or kill themselves over and over when they die once and it apparently bans you for 30 minutes when you do that. When that happens I'm mostly like ""yay I get to stop playing."" Nintendo failed to balance their way out of metas so you're always going to have 50 Peaches spamming the butt attack one week and I dunno...Kirby doing some pink auto-win nipple dance the next.  Who cares anymore.<br><br>Buy this if you've got people in the room to play with and only if you want its frustrating nature to permeate and destroy your various friendships and family ties faster than Monopoly.</span>",My least favorite Smash Brothers,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFSVH5BFJNLMW53ABDVECJKIXWOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This, however, was very different. I now didn't need to choose which game I wanted to play, because all the characters are available. Of course there are changes, but I'm a very casual player, so Im not really affected by them. I also like that now you can play on any map in any form essentially. This makes it more fun to do a random map without worrying about a place like 'temple' coming up. Unlocking all the characters was such a journey, but well worth it. I do wish I tried out other characters during that time so I can learn their moves, but I was just trying to unlock them first...so I only know like 5 characters, but with all the echo fighters, and other just pretty similar fighters, it shouldn't be much of an issue, and like I said, very casual gamer here.

Was very disappointed after beating the World of Light to find there was nothing else to do but fight in every other game mode. Also the World of Light has steep variances in difficulty. I had to switch to easy to beat certain spirits, but switch to medium or hard to get a decent challenge out of the unlockable fighters and boss battles.<br><br>Pros<br>- Large array of characters.<br>- Long story mode that requires you to think a little<br><br>Cons<br>- All game modes revolve around fighting<br>- No cool minigames<br>- World of Light has steep variances in difficulties due to spirit abilities/conditions<br>- No ability to lower difficulty in Spirit Board.

As an occasional gamer, I get a lot of value out of this game. I personally focus on classic mode and unlock a lot of elements of the game through the classic matches (new characters, music, etc (it has a story mode as well which is fine but not my focus). As of 2019, you can use the gamecube controller for this game with an adapter (which I have yet to try but expect it to be fantastic).<br><br>Some reviewers who are new to smash have been turned off by initial impressions of the game. This is not a game to show off/play with friends the first night you open and play it. You have to play it and unlock its full potential. You will grow and develop into a better player doing so. If you want a fighting game for parties/gatherings and don't have the patience to unlock this game, consider something like capcom vs. or street fighter II.<br><br>Additionally, you need to make sure you have a tv or monitor that has gamemode.

I mean you can probably guess that seeing how you can pick ""the wii fit"" character as a fighter.<br><br>The game didn't came with a manual but there is a ""moves list"" for each fighter.

If you want to practice and improve, SSBU just isn't suited for it.

The roster is huge, but you only start with the original 8 characters. However, you begin to unlock new ones very quickly. Not sure if there’s any method to how you unlock certain characters, but they’re coming along at such a steady pace that I should get to my favorites without a hassle. The level selection menu is a little overwhelming so I tend to just stick it on random. The Adventure mode map is HUGE and will likely keep me busy for many hours to come.

It’s so good that I bought several copies for my other friends who couldn’t afford to get it on launch day due to being broke from Cyber Monday shopping. It does really bring backs nostalgic feeling once again with the Smash games combine into one(technically). Here is my own opinion/review on the game.<br>Pros:<br>The Gameplay aspect of the game is still basically the same with added mechanics that make it more fluid especially to some of the characters who were given upgrades to make them more enjoyable to use and the new additions to the series is like Sakurai said on several Nintendo Directs and it is mostly based on their moves from their respective series.<br>The Modes is what you expect from the Directs especially the adventure(World Of Light) mode. I won’t put any spoilers into this review but I can say that it is an ending for the series that give the fans for Hardcore and Casual gamers to be happy about.<br>Music/etc: The Music section aspect of it is for those who really enjoyed their favorite music list and function of listening it on the go is nice extra function. Recommended for those who enjoy listening to their favorite series music. Especially the opening of the game(Lifelight) and that is what you called a Fantastic opening for a game.<br>Cons:<br>Each character has a certain learning curve to master-or to the basics type of move set.<br>Online: Some issues with the online service, could see them already releasing a patch soon later in the month to solve most of the issue. Watch for lags and slow frame rate when playing online. Also paying $20 for online sevice(it's not that much like PS+ and Xbox Live).<br>Well thats it for my review of the game and I will enjoy it for a long time for the years ahead and it is a must for Nintendo Switch users to have this in their collection of Switch games. I will wait on buying the Season Pass until they show the second challenger pack next year. Well happy hunting everyone and for gamers out there, let’s spread the message of Smash of being the best hype game in the Year of 2018.<br>Hansuke21 signing out.</span>",Smash Ultimate Review: A place to come back to since Childhood.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZQLYVW7VXMZPB6DOELV2KRXOYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Who knows if a another one is on the way? Apparently their were other fighting games that came about compared to SSMB but they didn't  succeed to be better than SSMB. If this turns out to be the last one I guaranteed that their will be remake if necessary. I still have the SSMB for the 3DS and Wii U but no need for me play them anymore.

When I tried reinstall it to play it again an Update was due but I didn't have enough memory so I never able to play it again. I was lucky that I still had on my 3DS. But now this has arrived I'll never get rid of it ever.

Every fighter from the games before and new fighters come in to give the player an impression of the best that they can be. Some are better and some are worse (Little Mac but every fighter has a different profile of strengths and weaknesses that everyone can appreciate and not find frustrating to play. The new ""system"" has features that pros can appreciate but won't distract or discourage new players. Overall, it is coming off as the best Smash game.<br>Now here is my ONLY let down: World of Light feels grindy, boring, and I would REALLY much rather have sub space emissary from brawl, or adventure mode from Melee, or; better yet, more bosses for Classic mode would make this game AMAZING. I understand that they wanted to do something new and the symbolism, as well as the end of the game, are great. I am just not a fan of running into battle after battle equipping spirits for each and every encounter (same or less power level spirits give better rewards, so I was trying that). Others like me have eventually just choose one team and use them for the rest of the game instead of adjusting the spirit team.<br>Yes it is close to amazing, but what I am saying is that World of Light could have been done better.</span>",Is it Ultimate?,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSDRKDBGRXF56YDGE6JVZQKSEUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

World of Light isn't Subspace Emissary levels of good, but it offers enough to make this game worth revisiting 10 years from now. Classic mode is very carefully thought out, giving a small story so every one's story is themed. The cast is loaded and it's mostly a buffed up version of Smash for Wii U/3DS. My only issues as of this point is: Final Smashes suck, they are about half as strong as they were in Brawl, and most are stupid cutscenes or things that restrict your control. Online as of this point (3/14/19) sucks as well.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Well I’ll try to give this a serious review. This Smash iteration is the most polished out of them all. The game just works. For comparison, Melee had too many glitches which is what made it competitive, Brawl had too little hit stun and was too slow to do any combos at all and Meta Knight was just ridiculous, Smash For 3ds/Wii U had some combos but it really rewarded defensive play but you’ll find a compromise with all of that in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. If you want to play a party game this is it for you and also if you like to play competitively this is also for you. At first it was very weird getting into the game because of the new engine but when you get used to it. You’ll be able to zoom all over the place and just land hits reliably although not too recklessly. The only issue I have with this game so far is there’s a slight hint of delay with the joy cons. I have my TV set to game mode which the game recommends and also there’s a lot of buffer. What I mean by buffer is let’s say you press A to attack, and then you input a jump on accident after the attack. The game will still register what you input first so instead of doing any other action you jump instead. It got in the way of continuing my combos but I don’t think it’s too much of a problem. Hopefully it’ll be patched soon.</span>",I’ll try to review this seriously,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHUPLWWKM7F7WLTLPVCKLJVUIJLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Smash is usually at its most fun when you're playing with friends. But as you grow up, the likelihood of living near your friends who would be willing to play Smash lowers, so you usually play it solo. I'm happy to report that this Smash has a really engaging solo-player aspect, mainly in the form of the World of Light campaign and spirit board challenges.<br><br>While not as good as Brawl's Subspace Emissary in terms of story, it definitely has more interesting content and just lots of content in general. I was bummed when the previous gen of Smash didn't have as robust of a single player experience and non of it had any kind of story, but the World of Light has both.<br><br>I also like the classic modes, which is like the original Smash's single player where you fight a series of configured battle based on which character you choose. This one adds more fun to it by basing the fighting conditions throughout each battle on the character as well. For example, Kirby's love of food is reflected through his classic mode by having healing food items available at the start of each battle. This makes each classic mode extremely unique from one another, so you don't get bored redundantly playing similar matches throughout. And it's especially fun if you're familiar with the characters and see the tweaks based around their characters.<br><br>So in short, I recommend this game, especially if you're looking for a fun single player experience instead of just a multi-player/online match only game.</span>",Great fun for both single player and multi-player,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKWNPGZIGP4FPRWM7HIHW5KKCNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The game is still infinitely better than trash 4 and has a fairly long single player experience for those than enjoy that aspect. Faster moves with much less lag, more match customization, pretty well balanced characters, promised patches, pretty much anything you could ask for. Right now there irritating glitch (hopefully a glitch) where using the new instant shorthop aerial causes your momentum to shift in the direction of your aerial. Hoping it will be patched but it doesn't really break the game.

I hope you have fond memories of playing online games via Dial-Up. Just kidding, it's worse. Let me explain why...<br><br>First, the online performance sucks. You'll lag. You'll cry. You'll keep playing and wonder why.<br><br>Second, if you want it to suck just a little bit less--and I do mean just a LITTLE bit less--you have to buy an ADDITIONAL piece of equipment (USB-to-Ethernet adapter).

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Definitely my favorite Smash Bros entry of the entire series. One could even say it's the ""Ultimate"" version of the game. It can be played for hours with friends and I've even enjoyed playing on my own, though that isn't quite as fun as playing with a group of friends and family.<br><br>I will admit it can be a confusing game to jump right in to if you've never played a Smash Bros game before. However, it can be enjoyed by little kids and adults alike. Make sure to watch the ""How to Play"" video after the intro to the game to get a basic idea of how the game works. These games have a pretty unique take on the fighting game genre, so I'll leave a basic summary below.<br><br>The goal is to knock your opponents off the edge of the screen to reduce their lives. As you hit your opponent their percentage goes up. The higher that percentage is, the farther they will fly away when attacked. When a character is knocked out, they come back at 0% and continue battling until time runs out or they run out of stock/lives.<br><br>Each character (there are 74!) has different kinds of moves, strengths, and weaknesses. There are multiple items, modes, and stages/levels in the game. The best way to learn it all is just to play. You'll quickly find characters you enjoy playing as and develop a fighting style that's all your own.<br><br>I realize I haven't said much about the game yet, but there is so much going for it that it's hard to pick things out. The music, sheer number of stages and characters, and overall polish to the game is astounding. In terms of changes between previous versions of the game, some of my favorite things are:<br><br>1) The physics of the game are the best so far. Its crisp, fast paced, and not as floaty as Brawl. Knocking people away, trying to get back to the stage, and performing combos just feels so fluid.<br>2) Setting custom rulesets. I have my default 3 stock no items for 1 on 1 or true skill matches. I have a 3 stock all items high and smash meter on for the free for all party play. You can set the rules up whatever way you like and set a preset which makes getting in to play that much faster.<br>3) Starting with the original 8 characters and unlocking all the new ones is actually really fun for me and never felt like a chore. Anyone complaining about this part must not remember what it was like to get Mewtwo (20 hours of vs matches) or Game and Watch (1000 vs matches) in Melee or Wolf in Brawl (450 matches). In this mode you get the chance to beat and unlock a challenger every 10 minutes of VS play, or even quicker if you reset the switch after every match. You also face a challenger every time you finish classic mode, or throughout the new Spirits mode in World of Light. It really is fun to watch the roster grow, and doesn't really feel all that grindy unless you are in a huge rush to unlock every one. If there is a character you really want, look up the charts that show you who unlocks who in Classic mode and you can have the character you want within 30 minutes easy.<br>4) Slow-mo on knockout hits, extra damage in 1v1, the overlaid out of bounds box when someone went flying, and the smoke trailing characters matching their color are all huge quality of life improvements.<br>5) Everything? I could go on and on. I love this game. Within a night of playing it was without a doubt my favorite game of the series.</span>","Amazing Game, Best Smash Bros Yet!",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDLJB34FRFZGXJXF3COOQ3U5IEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

There's plenty of improvements/changes over the last Smash with everything you love about this game series: all your favorite characters and stages, single player content that is enjoyable in small doses, and it will still be your go-to game for local multiplayer.<br><br>As others have already ranted plenty about, the real killer of this game is the online. The ""preferred rules"" concept is terrible. You frequently can't play the type of stages you want, you can't change characters between battles, etc. etc., but I expect that to improve over time (it already did in the first patch). The real problem with the online... is you.<br><br>I'm not a ""pro"" that participates in tournaments and argues with other ""pros"" on reddit; I primarily play to have a good time and enjoy 1vs1 Smash 4 ""for glory"" style battles the most. However, with the introduction of the GSP ranking system, the online community has been reduced to a slop fest of trolls who will do anything they can to win a match.<br><br>You're happy that your favorite character Snake is back? When you meet him online, expect to be placed on a BF map with 3 stock and 7 on the clock then be zoned with grenades and other projectiles in an unrefined manner until the clock runs out. I'm completely fine with using projectiles; I'm not some elitist who thinks touching the B button for anything other than recovering makes you a noob, but there's a difference between using them effectively and using them to annoy your opponent to death.<br><br>No more taunting? Not to worry. Everybody will make sure to skip around throughout the battle and/or frantically run back and forth between kills to assure you that they are superior. I'm not sure if they actually think they're fooling you while you respawn or they are just trying to piss you off, but you didn't see this kind of behavior in Smash 4 nearly as often.  A personal favorite of mine are the players who repeatedly do their best hit box dance while waiting for you to attack, resulting in a painfully long and boring match. And that's just it; the online battles are BORING.<br><br>Hopefully these people will lose interest after they fill up enough tiles in their Elite screen and go back to Fortnite. I'm certainly getting tired of playing already, ending my morning Smash &amp; coffee sessions questioning myself as to why I'm still playing this game. Maybe I'll go back to Splatoon 2 for a while and wait for the Smash community to improve.<br><br>If you're reading this and happen to be one of these players, I hope a dragon with the face of your grandfather and giant ram horns crashes through your roof and psychically forces you to eternally relive the traumatic event(s) from your childhood that caused you to become this type of player.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>So far I am enjoying the game, I have tried a mix of the different modes, including the story mode, regular brawls (up to 8 fighters locally!), online, and the new Mii fighter creation, and have found all of these aspects to be well made so far. The only issue I have is the removal of features such as the target destruction/home run mode and one of my personal favorites, the stage builder. Used to play ridiculous custom stages in Smash Bros. Brawl all the time such as a stage completely enclosed in a box made up of spike floors with only a small hole to launch out of. I hope that Nintendo decides to add this back at some point in the game. I know not everyone used it, but is there really a point in taking out a game feature? I would have even been happy with the exact same builder from the Wii version. If added in a future DLC, I will return to revise this review.<br><br>Edit: With the stage builder, I am now 100% satisfied!

Basically it is supper fun, It has a great story mode, smash mode, and so much more.  Before  my brother played it he  was like, meh that doesn't sound fun, but then he played it and he said that it was his 2nd or 3rd favorite video game. It is a supper fun family game if you are having a party, or still really fun if you want to play by yourself. I would recommend it for basically everyone (unless you don't do video games) Its a fun game just to pick up and play, but if you are supper competitive it is also really fun. I didn't have any smash games, but then I tried one at my friend's house and it was supper fun, so I was going to get a wii U (that's what he had) but then I realized that Nintendo was coming out  with a new smash for the Nintendo switch, so I bought a Nintendo switch and waited for what felt like 10 years but really was only one then I finally got it and so far it is a blast!

And this is a huge video game crossover with so many iconic video game characters and franchises represented here. The music libary is the best smash has ever had with easier ways to your favorites and a huge pool of classic and modern video game tunes. Graphically this game looks much better than smash for Wii u. A consequence of that is that it is easier to lose track of your character. More things that were disappointing is the race to the finish in classic mode and missing several classic modes like break the targets and home run contest. World of light can also be repetitious at times. But overall this is the best smash bros. game with the most content and is the easiest for newcomers to get into.

The director, Sakurai, never disappoints and I undoubtedly say Ultimate is the best in the series so far. It has almost everything a Smash fan can ask for and plenty to do to keep you busy on the game for hours upon hours. It has the biggest roster to date in the series and they're still adding more and balancing them out. Only thing the game is missing is more cutscenes and character interactions in its story mode and I'm disappointed that Waluigi isn't playable in it (AGAIN) but I'm hopeful Sakurai might troll us all like he always does and make Waluigi the last DLC character. Other than those 2 things, it's a near flawless game. 9/10.</span>",The Best Smash Yet!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF36IIC3PEEUVWT4XK3N62IEXW4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It has met all of my expectations for a Smash game, and I would recommend it to any fan of the series. The game has every character ever in a Smash game, over 100 stages, and also looks beautiful. Smash Ultimate plays a lot faster than Brawl or WiiU/3DS, but not as fast as Melee. It is a great middle ground for fans of the series. The only downside right  now is the state of the online infrastructure. Many games can be laggy when playing online, especially in 4 player matches as one player's bad internet connection can hinder the experience for the rest of the players. This, however, has not detracted from my personal enjoyment of the game as I generally play with friends in-person, but if you plan to play online a lot I would keep the current sub-par online experience in mind.</span>",Best Smash Bros.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>For those unfamiliar with Smash Bros: This is a fantastic game for people of all ages. You can take control of characters from many of Nintendo's iconic game franchises, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, Animal Crossing, and more, with some guests from Sega, Capcom, Square Enix, Konami, and even Namco's Pac-Man. This game is designed so you mostly play against each other, but there's nothing wrong with pairing up and facing computer opponents or real people over the internet in team battles. You already have enough controllers for two because of the two Joycons that come with the Nintendo Switch, but for a more comfortable option, there's a full pair of Joycons, the Switch Pro Controller, and the Nintendo Gamecube Controller, but you need the Gamecube Controller Adapter to use those. A Must Have for the system, whether for children or adults.<br><br>For Non-Casuals: Fantastic. This game feels incredible. There's a certain swiftness and power in this game that I didn't feel in Smash 4. First of all. Look at the UI. It is streamlined and kind of gives off that competitive feel. Characters KO faster and most, if not all characters that I know of , have kill-confirms, so you have a certified option to defeat your opponent. Online is on the weak side. For me, an ethernet adapter made a difference, but if your opponent has a bad connection, you will. Hopefully, Nintendo will improve the game's netcode. Just get it. It's GREAT.</span>",The Lovechild of Melee and Smash 4.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGC23RQ4ORBGLAMLOM77VY7RVY2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

One thing that is annoying tho is that you choose the stage before the fighters, which I believe is a little bit worse than the old choose the fighters first way.

It's been far to long since I've played perfection. Sure little things like menu navigation and messing with the spirits could be tweaked and improving load time per match as well even by a few seconds would make this 10/10 game Thay much better. I'm a collector.. I want everything unlocked I want to beat everything.. Everytime I think I'm getting close I find 10 more things to do.... Is there such a thing as to much content? Mario party is a 8/10 do to lack of content but I've had a blast playing it with several groups of friends... Smash I can be a hermit for all I care with 80+ hours of game play to keep me busy hell maybe more and will log more! I've been hyping myself up for months keeping myself from spoiling it and only watching what Nintendo wants us to and I must say... That game is 10x better then I thought... I don't regret it in fact I'm more then happy to drop the 25 on dlc because how much I'm enjoying it so far! Sure it's not for everyone but man is this game for me!<br><br>Update: after some time of playing this game and exspoling what it has to offer I still love it and just beat the spirt world with 30 hours in just that with 100% completion. I am oh so pleased and I love how the light fighters can deal Alot of damage very quick but they don't have the power to knock people out of the ring early. The heavy hitters have the power to deal Alot of damage and knock players out early but suffer from being slower and soaks up damage.. So depending on who you play as and how you play determines how well you do against an opponent.<br><br>Players that I loved and wanted to be my main because they used to be my main are no longer my favorite to play as and players I used to hate and would never touch are now my mains.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Opposite of what Mario Kart deluxe did for me. In MK deluxe, pretty much everything is unlocked. I had no motivation to play it. I like playing things to see new content and feel rewarded in a meaningful way. Titles do nothing for me; earning a 1st place trophy in itself means nothing to me. This is why it was such a relief when I first started Smash Ultimate to find only 2 characters available. Yes! This means I will need to earn the other characters and not be spoon fed (where's the fun in THAT?).<br><br>Speaking of unlocking, you can do that in adventure mode. As a newbie, I was really surprised how difficult it is! In order to progress, you need to defeat enemies, and each one is marked with stars indicating their difficulty level. IMO, there's a drastic difference between 1-star enemies (novice) and 2-stars (advance), which can feel like beating a difficult boss in other games. Thankfully, the campaign is structured in a way that makes higher difficulty enemies optional. It feels addictively challenging rather than frustrating.<br><br>That said, Smash feels much more approachable than other fighting games because it doesn't require you to remember complex button combos nor restrict moves to specific battle conditions. For example, in Pokken Tournament, you need to memorize at least 3 button presses for many moves and also need to know specific button timing and whether your fighting near/far.. I think Smash's approach is more strategic and doesn't punish you on reflex and memory, in contrast. That's what makes it fun to me.<br><br>The game is pretty overwhelming in terms of content. The lack of tutorial makes it intimidating at first, but if you take a moment to study the button mapping, you will realize that it's pretty simple and consistent across all characters. The trick is in understanding each character's specialties (e.g. only Kirby can learn opponent's skills by inhaling them). To me, this is a much lower learning curve but also stronger emphasis on strategy. If this is your preference, then definitely get this game. So far the only fighting game I can get into.</span>",Fun difficult and may be addicting,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7VSOQAP5HRAEYWOQHJ2S5SNBMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,3.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I've played Smash since Melee and while Ultimate is the best one of them all I feel like the 'patch it later' mentality has left the game not quite complete.  In terms of Smash itself and the Spirits of Light they're fun and for the most part I've got little to no problem with it.  Why the 3 stars?  Well...<br><br>-My memory is fuzzy but I remember on at least Melee if you lost against a new challenger you could fight them again after the next Smash.  Here it's being a 'door' in the Games &amp; More section that isn't as straightforward as the initial encounters.<br>-New challengers AI varies from challenger to challenger.  Some matches I've had end in 2 seconds and some are ridiculously easy.  It's not consistent.  I can expect earning new characters to be a challenge there are times that the game makes it more of a chore than actually fun.  Considering that about 60+ characters need to be unlocked it can take a while.<br>-The ability to capture video is disabled and can only be done haphazardly on the replay mode.  The replay tools are pretty bad to which if one wants to get a funny snippet of a 15 minute match (I appreciate the increase from 3 minutes) they have to wait at 1X until that point, capture, and then wait for the match to finish to properly process the film, otherwise it errors with a 0/0/0000 datestamp.<br>-The menus aren't as simple to navigate compared to previous games.  In fact going far as outside of the Smash mode effectively logs everyone out, amiibos included (understandable), to which having to go back and reset my character and skin is old after the 30th time.  Previous games, especially Melee, I remember keeping the stuff intact until a different game mode was played.  I'm also baffled why character select is AFTER the stage select.<br>-There is not a way to prioritize music in the stages.  In previous versions (not Melee) one could assign probabilities as to how often select songs will play.  Here, if I'm understanding it correctly, one can pick the song they want every time they want to pick a stage.  Otherwise stages will default to what's appropriate.  On the plus side the music selection on the stages is per franchise rather than the stage/game itself though this means Nintendo stages will have 85 tracks to choose from without indication as to 'what game/franchise' it came from.  To put it into an example. On the Sonic stages I know where Green Hill and Scrap Brain Zones are from but not Fist Bump and Rooftop Run.<br>-The World of Light single player campaign is pretty good, though I'm not sure the penalty for losing is, if any.  Previous games took coins out.</span>",Fun as Smash goes but needs a bit of polish.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSUNWOWPE52NOAK4AJE3WYFSZNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Two months later, and after having learned that you just can't treat this game like a traditional fighter like Mortal Kombat, I've unlocked all characters, and finished the Adventure Mode.<br><br>The game is still ridiculously difficult at times---even when you know exactly what you're doing---but it was enjoyable to be taken through the worlds of Legend of Zelda and Castlevania, which are huge favorites of mine to this day.  Adventure Mode will require about 40-50 hours of your time to finish, and before you do so, you must assemble a team of three to fight a gauntlet of every single one of the game's bosses before you make it to final battle.  It was ridiculously hard, but I saw it through, and unlocked the 'true ending'.<br><br>It was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a video game, let alone a game that demands this much of your time and patience.<br><br>So, even when I eventually started to enjoy Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, it remains a one-star review; a horrible overrated, overhyped conglomerate of nostalgia and flashing lights.<br><br>Horrible game.

Ultimate,2.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I just don't get it. I had never played a Smash game before but always heard amazing things. This game came out to rave reviews. It made several top ten lists and was highly rated in the 'Top Games Of 2018' for a gaming podcast I listen to. This seemed like a slam dunk purchase, so I pulled the trigger. I regret it.<br><br>This game is an absolutely beautiful mess, but it *IS* a mess. There are a ton of playable characters, and they are all ridiculously unbalanced and locked at the beginning, meaning you have to pour in hours of your time to unlock them all ... so you can figure out which ones are unplayable. The single player campaign, prob the main reason I bought the game in the first place, is an exercise in frustration. Nothing makes any sense. Here, you're fighting this recognizable character, who is possessed (yes really) by this D-list character. Did you finally win? Awesome, you didn't unlock anything except some extra sprites on a few more confusing screens. Oh did you want to play as that character? Keep on button mashing. Even the menus are frustratingly convoluted. Want to play the single player? It's 3 menus deep, keep on clicking. No menu screen works the same way as the last screen you were just on (yes really). Just getting into a match is a challenge.<br><br>No tutorial. Click around the confusing menus and you can find some 'training' which still assumes you have played a smash game before. If you're trying to get started, watching a few hours of YouTube videos is basically required just to learn how to play.<br><br>But it's an amazing party game, right? Is it though? Is it a fighting game? Yes? No? Maybe but not really? You don't have health, but it's completely possible for someone to just hit you enough times that you die (and not by flying off the platform) ... so really you DO have health? Only it's hidden? Did your opponent just select one of the INVINCIBLE characters that are in this game? Whelp, have fun getting destroyed.<br><br>Playing the CPU? Oh did you try to use strategy and actually bring their damage meter up over 100% ? Have fun as the CPU unleashes it's super-secret finishing move which will one-shot you wherever you are one the screen. DEFEAT! Remember, if you throw that controller and break it, Nintendo wins when you have to replace it.<br><br>Everything about this game is random. The characters, who is playable and who is not, who is a spirit vs. who is playable, the mechanics, the dynamics, the menus, and -- most importantly -- the match results. People are going to tell you that there is strategy. Kids pump hours and hours into this believing that whatever they're doing matters and affects whether they win or lose. I think the dirty little secret is that it's all completely random. Mash some buttons! VICTORY! DEFEAT! See that was fun, right? RIGHT?!<br><br>The joke is on me since getting a refund on a video game is essentially impossible these days.</span>",Mass Delusion,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHLV7GWZZ2ZHUHU6CJ7JENWMMJ3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

What a way to celebrate the original game's 20th anniversary next Spring! But it don't stop there, Ultimate contains lots of other amazing stuff, music, and challenges too numerous to mention! How can all that fit in just 1 tiny game card, even GREATLY bypassing the 3DS game?! If it's not already sold out by Christmas, in any year for now, and wanted to try it on a Switch system belonging to you or a friend or family member, by all means, dig in! The characters have been fine-tuned for more fair fights; too bad the Oscars never were claimed to be fair, even today, especially to numerous Looney Tunes shorts during their Golden Era! What's more, Kirby's got a LOT of copying to do, take it from me! Like the Wii U and 3DS games, Ultimate will soon have added characters via DLC, like a Piranha Plant still in his pipe! I'd love to try and kick my new brother-in-law's booty at this masterpiece, it's even accessible to Gamecube Controllers and adapters for the Wii U, which I'm best at!

In fact, I'd recommend hardcore fans of the series stop reading this review right now because I'd rather not make anyone as upset as me right now.<br><br>I'm done with this crap! Controlling the characters was always a bit like trying to draw with a marker attached to a string, but it might actually be worse in this case. The developers of the Kirby games should just stop having any part in this series. It barely works for Kirby games and it doesn't work for this! I tried this because I like playing as certain characters, but it's time to face the fact that the gameplay just isn't for me... Maybe it never has been. Sorry this is coming off more like a blog rant than a review, but I had to let some steam off somehow.

Ultimate,4.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I grew up playing the original Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64. I loved being able to play as a variety of characters across some well-known (and perhaps less well-known) Nintendo franchises. With each iteration of the series, I’ve enjoyed seeing new characters representing new and classic games join the roster. However, even if I can understand cutting some characters as the series moved forward, it was still a disappointment when I couldn’t play as my favorites in subsequent entries in the franchise. This is why I was hyped up for the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.<br><br>For the first time, I was able to play as a staggeringly large number of characters. The fact that (almost) everything from previous games made it into this one made it feel like this was a celebration of the history of video games and not just a party brawler. And while I didn’t bother with the DLC for the 3DS version of the series, I jumped right in and got the first DLC fighter pack when it was released. This speaks to how Super Smash Bros. Ultimate appeals to me in that I want the fullest experience of the game that already had a pretty full experience.<br><br>And while I appreciated the “World of Light” single-player campaign and the “Spirits” that can be used to enhance the player characters, the amount of unlocking I needed to do so I could play as my favorite (or some of the newer) characters felt a bit tedious at times. Plus, with so many characters to choose from, there is a bit of choice paralysis that has prevented me from completing most of the single-player story modes with these characters. Still, the game remains approachable for all skill levels, especially if you want to play by yourself.<br><br>A party brawler that’s Nintendo’s love letter to the history of gaming, I give Super Smash Bros. Ultimate 4.0 stars out of 5.</span>",A party brawler that’s Nintendo’s love letter to the history of gaming.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPKTKAUAD3ZVLH4NEGWTLQJGV6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,3.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>As others mentioned having all the characters and levels came at a cost. I would almost consider this game to be a for a collector than a gamer. You can say all of the characters and levels are playable but if you like playing the game, it leaves you wanting to dust off the Wii version.<br><br>The “adventure” mode in this is single player only and just a normal battle with set conditions to alter the fight. These are repetitive and a harder one is simply more annoying than more challenging. Spirits are fun and bring nostalgia, but most do similar things. So, you lose interest quick.<br><br>Personally, I found starting out with all the levels to be a bit overwhelming. If I want a quick fight, I will not go through and look at all the stages to pick one. I will jump in one I know and since I’ve had them all from the beginning, there isn’t much reason for me to try a new one unless I am looking for something different.<br><br>Characters unlock based on time played. At first I thought this was great because i didn’t want to play for hours trying to meet certain conditions to unlock everyone. After I have played for 9 hours and have everything unlocked, I miss the challenge of working to get a new player. Again, getting everyone so quickly never gave me the desire to play as someone new.<br><br>Smash is and always will be a COUCH fighting game with friends. The online leaves much to be desired and since you have to pay $20 to play Nintendo online, I cannot say it is worth it if you are buying that just for this game.<br><br>Although it will still be great having friends over and playing this, there is nothing in my opinion to make me want to turn it on when it is just me, which the other games had. 9 hours does not = $60 in my book. I would say this is for the completionists or die hard fans only.</span>",All characters/levels not worth losing all side games,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJZNY33U2Z2JFZQR5AWHTSF4I3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

All the best N64 and GameCube stages included. It plays flawlessly, albeit still getting used to playing with a pro controller. Even after we’ll over a decade, I still feel like I’d be so much better using a GameCube controller, it’s funny. I will likely get the adapter just for this game.

Ultimate,2.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>The online for this game is pretty terrible. You cant pick the rules you want (even if you want no items, too bad the game doesnt care what you want) It rewards people who disconnect by letting them keep their online score and the winner gets nothing (genius idea nintendo). There is a lot of lag.<br><br>They put little effort into expanding the online experience but dont give us much for single player in exchange. The ""adventure mode"" is nothing but a fancy giant flat map and you just fight battles one after the other with varying degrees of the same mods (this time the enemy cpu is metal,giant,fast,slow,etc). So they didnt want to give us a good online experience, or an offline experience, so what the hell did you want to give us??<br><br>The only redeeming thing this game has over the other games is purely the roster (all characters in the series + some new ones, tho now I'm thinking this was a gimmick to distract from the messiness of the rest of the game). And yes it does look very nice (tho were in 2019, good graphics is a given at this point so who cares)<br><br>Had high hopes with this game and yeah it has been fun for a little bit but once you play you realize the priorities of development were more for marketing and to boost sales (up front things to show off like brand new graphics and roster) rather than giving us a consistent, replay able experience to last for years.<br><br>Of course this is my opinion and you may disagree but this is my review, grain of salt, etc...</span>",Nintendo doesnt know what they want to do with this game,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7EE4CYQQOEXU667NNVICOUBASQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>The multi-player aspect deserves six stars.  The single player features are absolute trash: the game would have been better off without them.<br><br>The multi-player:<br>I've never had as much fun playing a video game as I have sitting around with my friends knocking the crap out of one another's characters.  The game is so dynamic and fast paced.  There is enough noise to mix ensure that even the best players can sometimes get tripped up, but skill is definitely rewarded.<br><br>The game can be overwhelming for newbies:<br>Part of what makes this game so great is also part of what makes it so daunting for newcomers.  I am relatively new to smash myself, and, while I was happy to put in the hours needed to feel comfortable with the control scheme, it is not the sort of game that you can just pick up and play with proficiency in a half an hour.  Being able to reliably get smashes and tilts when you want them takes time.  And this has made it more difficult than it would otherwise be to get those of my friends who don't already play smash to join in.  So, if you are the sort of person who doesn't already have friends who play smash, or if you're the sort of person that likes to introduce your friends to new things, you may have to persuade them to put in practice.  But, as I said, part of what makes this game so great is also what makes it so daunting...the variety.<br><br>The variety!<br>Sakuri did an impressive job of figuring out how to build in a wide variety of game commands using the controls that are available in a modern controller.  Tilt the joy stick and press the attack button, get one sort of attack, smash the joy stick to the side and press the attack button, get another sort of attack.  Press your bumper to shield if you are stationary, or press your bumper and a direction to dodge in that direction.  The sheer number of input commands you can enter means that there are A LOT of different ways you can play any given character.  And the between-character variety is just staggering.  Each character is unique (a few minor reskins notwithstanding), and the kind of play-style you will need to adopt depends heavily on who your character is, who your opponent's character is, and whether you tend to be an aggressive or defensive player, an arial or ground-based player, and so on.  What this means is that there will always be something new to learn, new strategies to develop, and ever more nuanced combos to learn and develop.  This is what convinces me that I can play this game for the next five years and stand no chance of getting bored with it.<br><br>Handicaps:<br>One shortcoming with this game is the handicap system.  There are two ways you can do this.  The first is by manually entering a fixed amount of damage that the better player starts with (you can also have the game automatically calculate it based on previous matches, but it doesn't seem to be very reliable IMO).  While this works, there is a major drawback.  The whole point of this game is to launch characters off the screen.  How far a player gets launched depends upon how much damage they have.  What this means is that there are certain combos that only work when other players have relatively little damage.  These are important to learn because they are a way that you can get your opponent into the damage levels where you can actually launch them off screen and win.  But, if you are consistently playing against players who are better than you, you cannot perform those combos and so cannot learn them.  The alternative is to have the better player start out with zero damage, but then there is no way to try to compensate for skill differences, and that can be demoralizing for players who are new to the game.  The other way to try to implement handicaps is through the use of the spirit system.  Spirits let you modify your characters damage, defense, and other statistics.  Some spirits are more powerful than others.  So, you could try assigning stronger spirits to weaker players and weaker spirits to stronger players to try to balance things out.  This gets complicated, however, because spirits level-up as they are used.  So, unless you max out a bunch of spirits, which takes a long time, you won't have any way of figuring out, in general, which spirit works best for which player.  A much easier mechanic would simply be to allow players to independently adjust how much damage or defense their character has.  It would make the handicapping system a lot more natural.<br><br>Online play<br>The best way to play this game is with your friends, in a room, yelling and screaming and fighting together.  But there will inevitably be times when you want to play a game and your friends are not around.  Enter online play.  It's a largely satisfactory substitute, but it has its frustrations.  The main problem is lag.  It is tragically common.  Even when you are willing to invest in an ethernet cable and an adapter, not everyone else is.  And people have different internet speeds.  Sometimes this is because they don't want to pay for better bandwidth, other times it is because they cannot afford it (we all do our best with where we are at), and still other times this is because people live in rural areas where internet connectivity is far from ideal.  What all of this means is that even if you are playing on a high-bandwidth  internet connection, your opponent may not be, and the game can only play as fast as the slowest player.  I think they could improve the lag problem by trying to measure the connection speeds of different players and trying to match them accordingly.  At least that way if your opponent is slowing down the play, you are probably also slowing down the play by a proportional amount.  While lag is a general issue with competitive online multiplayer and not one that is specific to smash, it can be very noticeable with smash because timing is of the essence.<br><br>Single player:<br>The campaign is just way, way, way too long.  It goes on and on forever and then it just keeps going.  It feels like what I imagine eating five pounds of bacon in one sitting would feel like.  At first it's great, but then there are still 4.5 pounds of bacon left to eat.  I do not know that I would mind the length of the campaign so much if the different matches had been more thoughtfully designed.  This is not to deny that some of the matches were clever and interesting.  I thought that the fight for The Boss's spirit seemed like a clever adaptation of the final fight from Metal Gear Solid 3, or as near as you could come given the elements available to the SSBU designers.  And there was one fight where all the players start out at max damage so that it's a one-hit-kill scenario, the goal was to emulate an old west shoot out.  But those sorts of matches were the exception, not the norm.  Most of the combat scenarios feel like they were put in there just because.  It's as though management came in and said to the developers, ""We want four hundred fight scenarios.  They don't have to be fun or interesting.  Just start grinding them out as quickly as you can.""  So, one of the designers looks over at another and says, ""Well, bombs are an item in the game.  We could have a stage that's just nothing but bombs raining down everywhere all at once for the whole match.""  And that is when the other designer said, ""Good idea, but there are different kinds of bombs.  We should do a scenario like that for each kind of bomb.""  Ugh...why!?  And other scenarios just feel like they were put in the game to frustrate players.  One designer looks at the other: ""Let's make the player fight a million Kirby's at the same time where they only use one kind of attack that doesn't do much damage but comes out quickly and interrupts whatever the player is doing.""<br><br>It also would have been nice if the fights had been arranged so that the early combat scenarios in the campaign were engineered to try to teach you different skills that you need to play the game.  E.g., they could have had a stage early on where shielding is really important, and labeled as such; and another where air dodging is crucial, and labeled as such.  This would have helped new players build the skills that they need to be proficient at the game.  And they could have made those matches optional for experienced smash players who would find such matches tedious.<br><br>Finally, the plot.  Why have it?  The plot to the single player is so unbelievably thin.  They should have tried to tell an actual story or just had a map full of different fights.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>This game is worthy of your love.  But it will take practice to get used to.  And it's a game you are going to want to play with friends.  If you don't like games that require a high buy-in cost in terms of practice time, or you just want to tool around on your own.  SSBU is not for you.  But if you want a truly unique fighting game with endless variety and a learning curve that never ends, then this is your cup of tea.</span>","Amazing multiplayer, terrible first player",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2QQXTNFESBLTHPAFJD6KJY3SWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>UPDATE: Less than a week after release, Nintendo and Bamco released a patch adjusting the matchmaker, so now Preferred Rules actually work as expected. In my several hours of play so far, looking for 1v1 No Items, I haven't been placed in a single FFA or 2v2 or Items On, and almost every match matched exactly my preferred settings.<br><br>So now the biggest flaw of this game is just about nonexistent.<br><br>ORIGINAL REVIEW<br><br>It's Smash Bros. Of course it's going to be good. But this game knocks it out of the park on so many fronts and only missteps in one right now that it's hard to give it anything less than 5 stars. I've played it like 20 hours in the past 2-3 days since release.<br><br>- This may be a point of division, but I LOVE THAT YOU ONLY START WITH 8 CHARACTERS. I love the constant flow of unlocking and growing your roster. Smash 3DS and Smash Wii U started with almost all characters unlocked, and it removed a lot of incentive to play singleplayer or to try out new characters. It made opening up the game the first time overwhelming and mad hard to choose whom to try out, and to this day I still have barely used some characters in that game. In Ultimate, starting with fewer characters means newcomers to the series don't get overwhelmed, there's incentive to try new characters as you unlock them, and there's a constant sense of growth. You unlock characters super fast too, with very clear and guaranteed unlock guidelines.<br><br>- Ridiculously well balanced cast. I've unlocked like 50 characters so far and thus far, none of them feel bad or unviable or absolutely broken above the rest of the cast. Every previous Smash game had this issue--maybe this one will too, but so far I'd been amazing being able to pick literally anyone and have a good time.<br><br>- Classic Mode is possibly the best it's ever been. Melee made some great leaps in making Classic Mode better. Then Brawl did more of the same, Smash 3DS did more of the same, and Smash Wii U was a bit all over the place. This Classic Mode is tailor-made for each character and the attention to detail mixes from impressive (Classic with Isabelle, for example, has you fighting against only the female cast) to downright hilarious (Wii Fit Trainer has you fighting against the...larger opponents in the game). There are also a bigger variety of boss battles than ever, and I haven't fought a single one yet that wasn't well-designed.<br><br>- World of Light is essentially themed Events Mode with an RPG system and malleable difficulty.<br><br>- The gameplay is so damn fun. The pacing is breakneck, but you always feel like you have the opportunity to get right back into the action. Characters fly around fast, but TIP: Follow the smoke trails because they're the best way to trace your character if you get hit hard! Melee will always have the most technical and hard gameplay in the series, but Ultimate has a very similar gameplay flow (favoring aggressive play with momentum, versus defensive and campy play) while being much easier for newcomers to pick up.<br><br>- Spirits are surprisingly addictive. When you recognize one from a game you've played and see how they hand-crafted that challenge, it's always damn satisfying.<br><br>- Presentation is absolutely superb. The music and visuals are so above-and-beyond, it's hard to not be super appreciative of just that.<br><br>- Overall, just so much content. 74 fighters, 103 stages, Battlefield and Omega Modes for every one, Stage Hazards toggle, saved custom rulesets, over 900 music tracks...this game could be $100 and still be worth it right now.<br><br>Only one misstep: The online. Preferred rulesets is a great idea, but right now there's not nearly as much priority on player orientation (1v1, 2v2, FFA) as there should be. I don't like wanting to go in for 1v1s and only get them 60% of the time. Fix that, and all of the new improvements they've made to the online will shine.<br><br>Doesn't hold me back from giving it an easy five stars though.</span>",Ultimate is not an exaggeration.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG5B55TXK7ZRSGIUMC5JANXYDM2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>*Might contain tiny minor spoilers*<br><br>A new Super Smash Bros. game is an event that only happens once each console generation, and it never fails to be hype. Smash Bros. Ultimate aimed to deliver the ultimate Super Smash Bros. experience in terms of content and it definitely achieves that. For those not very familiar with Smash Bros. games, these are Nintendo’s flagship fighting game series in which characters from different Nintendo properties, and also third party guests, battle each other in an all-out brawl. The mechanics are different from most fighting games though, you are to launch opponents off the screen by building up their damage meter and then hit them hard so they go flying, while avoiding getting launched yourself. Up to 4 players could traditionally play at once in a Smash game but now even up to 8 players can do so at once. (It’s super messy and overwhelming to have so many people at once but the option is there if you want it).<br><br>Super Smash Bros. games tend to be very hype not only due to tight and fast paced gameplay mechanics but also because it unites fandoms and brings nostalgia from so many different franchises into one game. Ultimate seems to be built under the premise of pleasing as many people as possible that have enjoyed the best parts of all 4 previous Smash Bros. generations. One of the first things we learned about SSBU is that “Everybody is Here!” meaning every single playable character from the entire series is back, with no exceptions. With this and also the newcomers added, we are talking about 73+ playable characters and even a few more are coming via DLC… so eventually we might be reaching close to 80 playable characters. This is an insanely high head count for this kind of game but they made it happen. Also most stages from past games made it back which is also very impressive, especially considering each stage can be altered to Final Destination or Battlefield versions, or even remove Stage Hazards which has been a long awaited feature.<br><br>This version also brings back Adventure Mode, but this is not the pseudo platformer quest that we had in Brawl. “World of Light” is more of a glorified Event Mode + Fighter Customization. In this mode you travel a large map and have to complete several event fights in order to capture “Spirits” which are stat boosters for your fighter with different effects that can be equipped on your fighter. This should help you move ahead in your quest and ultimately defeat the final boss. It is very different from Subspace Emissary, but if you ask me this is a lot better and more engaging gameplay-wise. For example there’s a fight based on the Pokemon Snorlax, in which King K. Rool will be conditioned not to move a lot.. much like a Snorlax. When you beat the match you will gain the Snorlax spirit, which will grant you resistance from being pushed by strong wind if equipped… Something that will be very helpful in other fights ahead.<br><br>One recurring theme that you will find in several modes of this game is how different characters and franchises from all over the gaming industry are represented in this game even if there aren't actual assets made in this game to do so. For instance, play Classic Mode as Street Fighter's Ryu and it will accommodate all fights to be in Stamina mode, Battlefield form and the Smash characters will pose as classic Street Fighter opponents even with their respective background music. For instance, a green Donkey Kong will pose as SF’s Blanka and so on. The game is never explicit on how they are referencing things so part of the fun is figuring things out and connecting the dots yourself.<br>Overall SSBU feels much faster paced than SSB for WiiU and it definitely feels like most characters where purposely made faster and stronger, making the gameplay for dynamic than ever. Will this win over Melee purists? I can’t say but it probably has a higher chance to do so than any other Smash game. I just say this game feels so right and satisfying to play, especially with friends.<br><br>As far as complaints I may have about this game... There’s a few. I would have liked to see more side mini games which beside that one and only one side scrolling bonus game in Classic mode, there’s none to be found here. I also understand why trophies didn’t return, but I would have at least expected them to have text blurbs on the Spirits so we could learn more about their origins. There’s none of that. The online gameplay as it has been traditionally with Smash can get super laggy, although this also mostly depends on the connection quality of each participant, but this is definitely something that doesn’t get a free pass anymore now that Nintendo charges for online service. We need a better online system for Smash. Last but not least, while I’m happy with all the new characters that we got, I’m not too thrilled that only 3 completely new stages were added. Seems like a weird complain considering there are 100+ stages to choose from, but from a long time Smash Bros. fan I was hoping to see more new environments represented. Considering Smash Wii U was released in 2014, very few games from the past five years are being represented in this game, and that’s very unfortunate. Instead we have to see dated stages like Pictochat and Elektroplankton.  (Not complaining they are there, I’m just saying it’s weird that those discontinued features as stages made it when more modern references didn’t.)<br><br>Phew! With all that said, this game is a must buy for your Nintendo Switch collection. It really isn’t a brainer. A lot of effort was put into this package and it is worth every peny.</span>",Smash Hit,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEKZWIRSLLUT5XOVLBIS5HLVEPCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Super Smash Brothers Ultimate really is the ultimate game of the series. Right away you have over 24 hrs of game music (before unlocking a little more), 103 stages &amp; 76 fighters plus 6 DLC later (1 free if you register by 01-31-2019).<br><br>Skill: You're given experience for playing, even if you don't win. (So losing will level you up.) I'm very limited (novice, horrible vision, no precision) &amp; yet I can manage to enjoy it with easy mode &amp; equipping the right spirits. The Spirits mode is an amazing tactical strategy exploration adventure that builds up your skills as you go. You release spirits of other videogame characters &amp; can equip them to add their ability to your stats to lower or neutralize negative effects of the current battle as well as to overpower your opponent. If you wanted then you can give yourself status effects to make a given battle harder.<br><br>Training: SSBU has several ways to teach you the game. There's a practice mode in which you can generate items or effects to practice on. Then during any match you can pause to see a listing of the smash moves. But the biggest teaching is the whole Spirits mode. You're started easier &amp; as you progress you'll likely decide to use different fighters, will play a wide mixture of stages, use a huge number of status assisting spirits, &amp; learn how to counter your challenges (such as speed decrease to help keeping control of yourself in a battle that will increase speed to uncontrollable levels, or wind resistance on a windy battle).<br><br>Art &amp; graphics: The attention to detail is amazing. The designers made everything look amazing, including stuff normally off camera or only briefly seen in battle while your attention is elsewhere. They didn't have to make backgrounds &amp; off camera areas look this good, but they chose to for the fans to be proud of the game we were given. More for non-human players (CPU vs CPU), during battles you can pause &amp; reposition the camera (zoom, pan, tilt, even rotate for smartphone layout, plus add filters). This is just like in Super Mario Odyssey. Now you can take great pictures of the action. Sadly, video capture isn't available, probably due to the graphics &amp; processing intensity already being quite a lot.<br><br>Content: With 76 fighters plus 5 coming, 103 stages plus more to come, already over 24 hrs of soundtracks that you can customize playlists &amp; frequency of being selected for background music. The tracks in the play menu are mostly 90-120 seconds, cutting at the loop/repeat point since there's no need in having them stored on the game in longer looped versions. there's so much put into this game. Then the Amiibo mode lets you have a custom challenger to battle yourself or set against the CPU opponents. Of course you can set up a custom battle of CPU players to see who's better.<br><br>Overall it's such a wonderful game to play &amp; watch, with a lot of options for customizing &amp; plenty of challenges for all skills.<br><br>Check out the YouTube video from GameXplain about ""10 secrets hidden off screen"". [Search URL  cfU5AdmhtWA  to find it, since I'm not sure if I can post the link. - I'm not affiliated with GameXplain or asked to promote them.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Have you played Nintendo games in the past 30 years? What if you could take your favorite characters from over 29 game universes and have them duke it out in a brawl for supremacy?<br><br>Super Smash Bros Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch brings over 74 (eventually 80) characters together in a great battle experience. In this game the main premise is that you play your character, trying to take down your opponents in a 2D-style fighting game.<br><br>There are a number of modes to play with multiple players (both online and couch) and single-player. For single-player mode, you can dive into the story mode, ""World of Light"", where you work to restore things as they were, unlocking additional fighters and obtaining ""spirits"". Spirits are effectively equipment for your fighters that affect attack/defense<br>power levels and confer other sorts of changes, such as immunity to level flip or reversed controls. Spirits are characters / items from other games, and are obtainable by winning a battle against some sort of representation of it. For example, one spirit is ""Nia"" from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 in which you fight a Mii Fighter dressed in a Nia costume paired with Incineroar representing Dromarch. Other sorts of spirit battles bring the ""spirit"" of<br>the character by changing the stage with conditions or pre-loading the opponent with certain power-ups.<br><br>In addition to ""World of Light"", there's also the ""Spirit Board"" where you can obtain spirits on a random board by battling and winning a timing game (shooting the puppet).<br><br>So far this game has a ton of content to keep you busy even in single player. The couch multiplayer also works great. One problem that seems to be worked on is the online multiplayer has an issue with slow players causing an entire battle to grind to a halt as the game requires exact synchronization. Unlike many FPS games where prediction/AI can be used to fill in gaps, this sort of game relies on frame-perfect synchronization.<br><br>An additional feature that helps change things up is the presence of online ""events"" in which certain spirits are<br>brought to the Spirit Board that normally wouldn't. Event spirits also give bonus rewards on completion, making obtaining ones you already have one of even more useful.<br><br>Coming down the pipeline are a total of 6 DLC characters, two of which have been revealed already. Pirahna Plant,<br>free to those who have the game registered by January 31st, and Joker from Persona 5.<br><br>Overall, I think this is a great game to add to your Nintendo Switch collection. It has a TON of things to discover, unlock, and use. It is a lot of fun to play alone and with friends, both online and off.</span>",Great addition to your Nintendo Switch collection,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSYZ4VEGVQIHDFYCP36ASMIZRJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Ultimate,4.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Technically this should be the Best Smash game ever, because it has ever smash characters available for play.  But I'm not too crazy about it. I wasn't even crazy about smash 4 for the wii u. Although I LOVED smash 4 for the 3ds. I think Melee had what most of the newer smash bros games have. It's a simple structure that all balances out perfectly. Melee had the arcade mode, challenges, great ways to unlock your characters, trophies. Smash Ultimate story mode was kind of lackluster to be honest, the world hub is basically just a drawn map you could travel from place to place but you have to fight the spirits to get through. It was a neat concept, but really spirits? why replace the trophies, they were amazing. I don't even care if you called them spirit trophies. I used to LOVE rotating the trophies in melee and looking at them for a while. All I can say is that Smash Ultimate is a heavily party fighting game. It has modes that can satisfy a lot of people. But the MEAT of all is the Spirit section of the game, and then you have online (online is always alright). All I'm saying is you can have ALL the characters in smash bros but when the main campaign is lackluster it really breaks the immersion. Whats going to happen is smash 6? are we going to get ALL the characters again plus more? Poor Sakurai, it's going to take him a bout 6-7 years to do another smash. I understand his vision with this spirit concepts, it makes us appreciate the facts that we need to have balance between light and darkness. If you have too much of one of the other. Your life will be controlled by it. I like that meaning, I LOVED the ending, but why don't i like the actual campaign. I felt it was repetitive.  I'd give this game a 7.5/10. I love this game, and I really wanted to like it more, but it just  feels like a better Smash 4 in my opinion.</span>",Feels like it's a Better Smash 4,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFMBPQYPQZAR4QN4JH5TDR4WSIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Nope, these clowns made the buggiest, least responsive and unbalanced game to date.  The story mode is also a lazy joke. The only saving grace is the sound track. You have 74 characters, only a handful are viable due to the horrible balancing.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>This game is definitely my favorite of the series, the controls are very responsive and satisfying, I love how Nintendo went with a more cartoony and cel shaded art style. The classic mode difficulty system is amazingly improved from the previous games, as it changes depending on how good you do. The battles you fight are also really cool because they depend on which characters you play as. But I wish they could add more unique bosses rather than just master hand and crazy hand for most players. The training trajectory lines are very vool, and the way you can choose what assist trophy or pokémon you summon is an awesome aspect. The final smash meter is really nice also, usually when I was playing in smash 4, my sister would always get the smash ball before I could, and it would end up being unfair. The final smash meter fixes that by giving everyone a fair chance to use a final smash. The way rule sets work is really cool now also. I hated having to change the rules from time to stock every time I booted up smash 4. The story mode wasn't really  a story and it was only 1 player, but otherwise it was a really fun 20 hours spent of getting super overpowered spirits to destroy CPUs with. At the end, (SPOILER ALERT) You play as master hand against ALL 74 CHARACTERS!! This was probably the best event match in all of the entire adventure. I thought the end was a little anit-climactic for how long it took to get to it, but, ya know, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. The entire thing was fun except for two spirits that I had to give up on fighting because they were too difficult. These spirits were Dr. Wily and Pauline. My sister had no problem with these ones and I saw that Dr. Wily makes it so the opposing fighter's final smash meter charges faster and Pauline, (I'm not 100% confident about this, but) Pauline's spirit heals you when your sheild takes a hit.<br><br>And the moment you've all been waiting for,<br><br>THE CHARACTERS!!<br><br>The characters are all super fun to play as (if you know how to) and unlocking them was really fun. I unlocked most of them through the story mode and that takes longer than if  you just fight battles and get Challenger approaching battles, but IMO the story mode way is more fun.</span>","If your kid wants this game, get it.

It had it's flaws and even at the time I probably thought it needed improving. But I didn't know what bad was. I can not play the online mode for this game for more than a few minutes before it is just not worth my time anymore. Virtually no control over game modes, you can't switch characters in between games if you want to play with the same people (unless you move and somehow coordinate with those people to a completely different game mode that you can not invite people directly to or communicate with them unless you have some app on your phone), and even the limited amount of control you do have the game treats like a suggestions. Tell it you want to play teams with no items? You will still end up in about 45% 1v1 or free-for-all with  items on or something. This game has so many great local modes and is seriously well designed and beautiful. Which is why it breaks my heart to say the online mode is so unplayable and frustrating that it will ruin your afternoon rather than be something fun. So if you only play local, this game is great. Maybe even worth the price of the game and all the eventual DLC. But if you want to play against real people online just skip this.

Every single character that has ever made an appearance in Smash Bros. is in this game. Most characters are relatively balanced. The ""story mode"" is more of a spirit collection mode. Spirits are the new collectible. They're basically just characters turned into abilities. There's also the spirit board, a place where you attempt to defeat an opponent to gain a new spirit. The spirits are a cool addition. You can even use them in regular matches to make things completely unfair! There's also the FS Meter. It's a meter that charges up a little every time you get hit or hit someone. Once it's full you can use a smash attack. Overall, this game is extremely fun and innovates in many ways from it's predecessor.</span>",Another great Smash Bros.

I've played hundreds of hours of brawl and Wii u,  each his feels like you hit, like for example if you up B someone as Luigi your heart RACES as you see it zoom as the spike noise plays<br><br>BUT, with all of this said... Online is a MESS, battle arenas are... well, for some reason you can't change rules unless you DELETE it, and if you're hosting your stage seems to never get picked, that's not even mentioning the fact that game play sometimes turns from maximum smash mode to ""1 sec I need to load"". Meaning the game pauses for up to 10 seconds. Random matches are a mess, everything is a mess, it's preferred rules instead of just rules, and while I'm on the topic of online... you have to PAY for online, you have to pay for a peer to peer non dedicated server mess of a service with little to no redeeming features while Nintendo is all like ""HEY!! LOOK!!! OUR OLD GAMES!!!! YOU KNOW THE ONES YOU CAN EMULATE FOR FREE EASIER THEN PAYING US"" now it WOULD make sense if you were paying for dedicated servers for smash where you DON'T PAUSE every five seconds and STILL have input lag, but it's not like that.<br><br>As someone who doesn't play online other then with friends in an arena it doesn't bring down my score as much as expected, but still, if you're buying smash for a pure online experience... well... you might be REALLY mad when you realise you just shelled out 60 dollars to have to pay 20 more dollars for literally nothing.<br><br>When it comes down to it, Sakurai probably has no say in what online can be, other then preferred rules and the stupid arenas, but hey, it's not as bad as I was expecting.<br>This is a honest 4/5 for me, but if the online was fixed it would be 5/5.</span>",It's smash.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6JZH5N5DN6SG23WTU7OH3QCYRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

If you want to unlock characters faster just play either classic mode or spirit mode on easy and new challengers appear often. (Make sure to beat them to unlock)  Cons: Some fights feel almost impossible to beat on adventure mode, A few fighters seem out of place and don’t belong in the game (example: Wii fit trainer, seriously?) The user interface can be confusing to use at times and there really isn’t much of a story to tell other than the intro. Lastly, online needs some work but is playable.

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>Being a Wolf fan and main, I'm ecstatic that Wolf is finally back in Smash Bros. and to celebrate, I bought a Switch just to play Smash Bros Ultimate xD  The game has over 70 playable characters and more will be announced as a DLC.  There will also be updates to the game where you will see buffs and nerfs on the characters to ""balance"" the gameplay.  Speaking of gameplay, while playing Wolf I noticed that there is some lag when I execute a smash attack.  There have been talks online that lag is common.  I don't know if that is part of the mechanics or if its actual lag but I got used to it pretty quickly.  Also, if you have a GameCube controller, dust off that old controller and buy a controller adapter because you can use it on the Switch now.  In fact, if you don't have a GameCube controller, you can still buy official controllers brand new!  Nintendo started remanufacturing the same controllers and you still need the adapter to use it on the Switch.  This shows that these controllers is a must for any Smash game.  If you have played Smash Bros. in the past, you don't want to miss this one!</span>",Wolf is back!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFIF4NVGHVAGS3H3KB7KJRVJMUJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Old fighters and a bunch of highly requested characters are here, and 6 dlc characters on the way, 2 of them being Phiranha Plant and Joker from Persona 5! Including all those characters, there's over 100 stages you can play on! And most of them are awesome stages! Now onto the singleplayer. World of Light is underwhelming for some, but awesome for others, and I'm with the ladder. If you don't like World of Light, no need to fear, Games and More are here! Games and more include Classic Mode, Multiman Smash, Training, Mii, and (i can't remember and I'm too lazy too...). There's a crap ton of content for every type of player!

Ultimate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>As 2018 wrapped up as a weird year full of great games and disappointments. We got one last big game before the end of 2019 year  and that comes with Nintendo’s Super Smash Ultimate. Where everyone joins the battlefield as Nintendo characters and guest characters duke it out. I was always a causal smash fan since I was a child. Playing Melee and 64 playing the Wii U version at a friends house. I picked up the latest smash game without hesitation owning a switch and it being the biggest game Nintendo released this year. Probably the biggest game of 2018. Is smash a smash? Or is it more of a crash? Let’s find out.<br><br>Pros:<br>Graphics, what was first thought a port of Smash 4 from the Wii U. Turns out it was a full sequel with various graphical improvements, smooth frame-rate and it looks great whether in handheld mode or big screen mode. While it's not the prettiest game in the world graphical speaking it still utilizes the power of the switch perfectly.<br><br>Gameplay, I don’t like fighting games they’re not a genre I got into. That being said Smash 5 has fun and addicting gameplay that you can sink hours to. As someone who is rather indifferent to fighting games this is high praise. If I can describe it. It’s an easy to learn hard to master. Whether causal or looking to be competitive Smash is definitely the game to play.<br><br>Unlocks, a thing that was common in the past returns in its full glory in Smash 5. As someone who remembers unlocking stuff before it became DLC and sold smash utilizes unlocking it’s amazing roster of 76 Characters in the Smash Bros. Ultimate Roster (74 if you count Pokemon Trainer as one character): 69 different unique fighters, 7 Echo Fighters. It has a Season Pass that will include 5 more fighters, with Joker from Persona 5 being the first character after that was revealed I bought the Fighter Pass. Even without the pass you still get a lot of content in the base game it must be praised that it’s all earned through playing the game. I remember when fighting games back in the PS2 used to do this all the time and it just vanished replaced by monetization. I cannot praise this enough.<br><br>Multiplayer, whether it’s online which we will get to later or local smash is a fun multiplayer game. While everything is fun with friend Smash invokes a child like wonder that few games can get out of me while I did grow up with the series with melee most games sequels lose that magic that made them special but not smash ultimate truly a timeless game series for everyone to enjoy both old and new.<br><br>Music, only mention music when it grabs my attention and Smash’s orchestral battle theme does just that. Plus various tracks and remixes from other Nintendo games. We get one hell of a soundtrack and score to accompany the game.<br><br>Cons:<br>Online, more of a Nintendo problem than a smash one but still bad nonetheless is the Online structure for the switch is dreadful. Sure it come a long way from the wii days but it’s still not good. Also nintendo is now charging for online while they’re the cheapest option in the market they’re still the most awful. Matchmaking is sluggish, netcode is sloppy, and it just a hassle it’s easier to trackdown your friends in real life and put them in one room than play online. Which I prefer the local over online but still this doesn’t excuse the poor online given the fact that Nintendo can make successful online live service games like Splatoon 2.<br><br>Meta, Bayonetta on launch day is more the enough said. But to elaborate if you play this game competitively than they’re only a certain viable fighters. Most will play this casually so it’s not a big deal but the meta changes are all subjected to change and it can either more the most balanced smash to date or the most broken. Only time will tell and for now the metas this ain’t it chief.<br><br>In conclusion, Smash Bros Ultimate closed 2018 in a bang. Putting it well into my top 5 games of 2018. It’s one of those games that make you have to buy a Switch. I’ve bought the Fighter Pass I’m excited for the Persona 5 DLC as I am a fan of Persona 5. Whether alone or with friends Smash Bros Ultimate is fun no matter. 5. Smash Bros Ultimate not only one of the best games of 2018 it’s one of the best in the Switch’s library an absolute must for anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch to play.</span>",Everyone Joins the Battle,

Best fighter ever (minus some of the issues online due to Nintendo living in the stone age and still using P2P connections...). I bought it for couch coop/parties and it's the best one yet. Super happy with this game other than the online issues, but I didnt take off a star due to the fantastic amount of single player content and the fact that it's basically the best game ever to get drunk and play with friends in person.
