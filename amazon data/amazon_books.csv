(Kids coloring activity books)",4.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>I think the workbook is straightforward.  It is educational similar to school.  There aren’t too many games/puzzles or “fun” pages. Depending on your child they might require something more interactive.  Introducing them to tracing and learning the shapes are probably the funnest part of the book.  The book is divided into three sections: shapes, letters, and numbers.  Each section has different page border colors: purple, orange, and pink.  I think it is nicely organized and sectioned.  There are 84 pages.  Letters have the most pages since there are 26 alphabet letters.  The book goes in numerical/alphabetical order.<br><br>One thing I thought was a little strange is the writing style of some of the letters.  It is different from how I write but maybe this is the easiest way to teach kids.  It’s been too many years for me to even remember how my school taught me.  Maybe it was the same way as this book but I just don’t write like that anymore.  The letters I noticed are capital M, N, and W (If allowed, I will provide photos with my review).<br><br>There’s a certificate of completion at the end of the book.  That’s cute and rewarding for the kids!<br><br>Age Range: 3 to 5 years<br>Grade Level: Preschool to Kindergarten</span>",Nicely sectioned and organized workbook,

(Kids coloring activity books)",3.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>This workbook takes a no-nonsense approach to letter writing—written more like a school text book than other workbooks we’ve used in the past that incorporate fun formats.  It also doesn’t begin with easy forming letters (Like E, T, F, or I)—Ms. Radke presents letter instruction in true alphabetical sequence, and suggests writing patterns on the top of each alphabetical page.  Some suggestions conflict with the way traditional printing is taught (or was taught to me).  Most people write W’s by slanting down, slanting up, slanting down, and then slanting up again—all in one fluid stroke.  This workbook does not suggest that same stroke pattern, and I don’t know why.  In those few instances, we simply ignore the given instructions, and follow formats that are more traditional and fluid.  Practicing numbers one through ten is also included in this book.<br><br>We’ve gone through many workbooks with our other children.  While this one does teach letter writing basics, it doesn’t incorporate much kid appeal like some other book sources do (Kumon series comes to mind).  Learning can be fun and educational—this one seems to miss the mark in that department.</span>","Teaches Letter-Writing Basics But Not In A Fun, Engaging Way",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFTK7QNAVJJYHBZCNOG4AAYTWNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

(Kids coloring activity books)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"<span>My son (5) has been struggling with making his letters.  It s something that came easily to his sister so his frustration level has been mounting (teacher ""Oh, look how nice your sister writes, why can't you do this?"" didn't help)  I got this book to give him the opportunity to practice independently of his sister.<br>Yes, I know you can print these online, and I have.  But my son REALLY likes having his own book to pull out and tackle.  The cover is thick cardboard and the pages are heavy stock paper.  The binding is nice and we haven't had any problems with pages falling out even with pressing it flat.<br>The book covers shapes, all the letters (taught with upper and lower case together like they do in school now), and numbers.  There are simply photographs on each page without a lot of ""clutter"" so the actual practice space is maximized.  One thing I really like are the little arrows and numbers to tell the child how to make the letter.  My son INSISTS on starting at the bottom of the letter, this book helps him remember to start at the top most of the time, although I did find that going through and adding a little ""start"" dot helped even more.  There is also a certificate of completion at the back of the book which my son is excited to earn and put on the fridge.<br>If you're looking for a practice book that focuses on letter formation without a lot of fluff, this is the book for you.  I recommend it wholeheartedly!</span>",Good workbook for the preschool or kindergartner in your life,

So we figured that with this book we could disguise are intent and tell em it's to get a leg up on next year. Which is also true.

Both boys would work together to finish as fast as possible and get back to the video games. Their writing got a little better and hopefully they retained what they learned.

The first six pages are hole punched and line up perfectly.<br><br>The story itself is about a little caterpillar who is very hungry. The rest of the story is about which types of foods he tries to eat to satisfy his hunger.

It may be better for older children, but it's not one of my favorites to read to him at this age (1-1.5 yrs).  I also don't love the illustrations because it's hard for him to learn/recognize objects given the somewhat abstract/artsy drawings.<br><br>However, my son *LOVES* the die cuts - he's obsessed with them.

It came in a beautiful, beautiful big box with lovely thick glowing pages, a treasure for a classroom. (The only negative might be that I have to repeatedly do this from my own pocket with California continuing to disgrace public education in its lack of funding  and the national sideshow to keep teacher's pounded while they do exactly that, get what they need out of their teacher's pocket, most often with no thanks. Or worse while treating them disrespectfully. However it's just to be expected now I suppose.)<br><br>That said this is just beautiful.<br>It is a book about transformation. I am a 1st grade teacher delighted to be able to use it as I develop lessons for my class. What is happening, of course, is that they are taking the stories read to them not long ago and then reading them to one another and beginning their journey into literacy with books like this. It is, as Carle said in a tape I own of him discussing his book making,  of his making, easing the journey from home to school, making it more comfortable and a better experience.<br><br>This story of the caterpillar munching away teaches on so many levels, formal and informal- from love of color, to fascination with the holes( the gimmick if you will), from the life cycle of this butterfly, to the days of the week, the idea of change...it's rich with possibilities and spawned the idea for derivative books my class is making this week and many joyful moments acting out and reading the text.<br><br>Who might want such a big book?<br>It's a great thing to donate to a primary teacher, I'd have loved it when my children were young, it might be a really exciting gift to a family with several youngsters 1 to 7 in age that might enjoy a really exciting special big gift, something that celebrates books, perhaps combined with a butterfly kite. That would be just a great combination if someone could afford it. You'd be giving something extraordinary. (And it could then one day rest with their children.)<br><br>Carle is among my favorite writers for younger children, and make no mistake, what appears simple and so easy is the product of someone that has done their personal work to a very high level. Distilled something to an essence. That this is 40 years old amazes me. It's the year to say, ""thank you Eric Carle"" for a wonderful contribution to literacy.</span>",An old friend,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEBDKKNTNBGX6HAZQJECCIQNZLOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The story is simple and real. The artwork is amazing to look at, and the little holes the catepillar makes in the pages while eating are fun for a little one to put their fingers on and feel. When we bought the book for our oldest in 1994, the book we bought came with a stuffed version of the catepillar that was about 8 inches long and was the favorite toy of our son's for some time until it was lost. This is an item I have had a hard time replacing as we have reintroduced this book to our youngest and is our second copy purchased for our middle daughter after our son wore out the first.

The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle is a book that my mom read to me pre- kindergarten.

No, it is not meant to be a  factual text that teaches scientific concepts to preschoolers -- neither  are fairy tales and nursery rhymes, but I don't hear anybody saying they  were disappointed in the lack of accuracy of Mother Goose! Instead, this  delightful little gem does something much more valuable; it sparks interest  and a sense of wonder.

The textures are distinct enough that by touching the pictures, one can fairly easily discern all the details of what is being illustrated.  For example, the first page of the story starts with text that reads ""in the light / of the moon / a little egg / lay on a leaf.""  The text has Braille superimposed on it.  Beside the text, the illustration begins - one textured material making up the sky background, another textured material making the soft leaf, and yet another material on top of that making the bump of the little egg.  So by touching the pages, one can both read the story and feel the illustrations without seeing anything.<br><br>The textured illustrations are very well made with an excellent variety of materials.  Some of the edges of illustrations that were made of cloth had a tiny bit of unraveling around the edges (but nothing serious), and the antenna of a caterpillar on one page came loose in my copy, but overall the quality of the illustrations and their textured materials is quite good.  The variety of textures used is far superior to most ""touch &amp; feel"" books.  I counted at least 20 different kinds of materials used, including twine, flannel, pipe cleaner, burlap, satin, and leather.  The book appears to be something that would hold up over time and withstand a fair amount of rubbing as one explores the illustrations by repeatedly touching them.<br><br>The story includes the full text; this is not an abbreviated version.  Even the pages with the foods are in the same format as the original edition and include the little hole in each food.<br><br>I believe that even children who are able to see the pictures would thoroughly enjoy this edition of the book with its creative manner of allowing the reader to interact more in depth with the story through touch.</span>",Touch & Feel Braille Edition: the best illustrative version of this book!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCUJIRYXGGCGHNKTI35JZM7IZTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Carle uses clever cutout pages to depict a caterpillar eating his way through the calendar week.

(Ages 3-6)” –<br>--Judith Rovenger, Sesame Street Parents, July/August 1994<br><br>“Carle's classic tale of a voracious caterpillar who eats his way through the days of the week and then changes into a beautiful butterfly has been reissued in a sumptuous twenty-fifth anniversary edition with a shiny, silver-coated cover and wonderfully thick, durably pages.”<br>--The Horn Book Guide Volume VI, Number 1 July-December 1994<br>“Every child should experience this wonderful, cumulative story, with its brightly coloured pictures of the tiny but greedy caterpillar that eats his way through one apple, two plums and three pears before turning into a beautiful butterfly. The board version stands up well to the inevitable poking of little fingers through the holes in the pages.” (2-4 yrs)<br>  --Kirkus UK<br><br>If this review was helpful please select the ‘yes’ button below</span>",Lovely...,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFD35IJL2XTS7DWCOXEYLFIEBBXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

They never get tired of it! We have a few of Eric Carle's books besides this one but The Very Hungry Caterpillar is our favorite. The book tells the story about how a little caterpillar pops out of an egg and he is very hungry so he eats...and eats...and eats! At first he starts by eating one apple on Monday, then two pears on Tuesday,and so on but it isn't enough so each day he eats more and more until his stomach hurts because he ate too much. I won't spoil the ending because it's extremely cute and fun for my twins to look at.<br><br>We have the board book edition and it's held up extremely well over the past three years considering we are still on our first copy of it! The book measures seven inches by five inches and is a great size for small hands. There are 22 pages in the story which includes fun, beautiful pictures. Each set of pages has one or two sentences so it's a nice length for short attention spans. One thing that is really neat about this book is that since the caterpillar is eating through a number of foods, there are actual holes in the pages big enough for a finger so kids can have fun sticking their fingers through where the caterpillar has eaten. I also like the fact that during the first five days the caterpillar is eating one apple, two pears, three plums, etc. so we've also made this book into a counting story on occasion.<br><br>The Very Hungry Caterpillar is one of my kids' favorite bedtime books and they love for me to read it to them! We love it so much we ordered it as a baby shower gift for a friend and she was pretty excited to receive it. I love the board book edition because it's very durable and we are still on our first copy after three years of twins looking at it quite a bit which is saying a lot! I can't say enough good things about this book and feel it would make a great gift for all babies and young children. I highly recommend it!</span>",This is One of My Twins' Favorite Books!,

I still love this book to this very day! “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” is a popular children’s book by Eric Carle and it is about how a very hungry caterpillar starts eating everything in its path. “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” is truly a cute and extraordinary book about food that children will love for many years!<br><br>Eric Carle has certainly done a great job at both illustrating and writing this book. What I really enjoyed about this book was Eric Carle’s illustrations as they are extremely colorful and cute. I love the way that Eric Carle illustrated the caterpillar having a green long body and a red head and Eric Carle also did a great job at putting a surprised expression on the caterpillar’s face when it first got out of its egg. I also love the illustrations of the caterpillar eating any food item that it comes across such as an apple and a piece of chocolate cake and you can see the cut out holes in the middle of the images of the food items indicating that the caterpillar ate through each food item. I definitely enjoyed Eric Carle’s story of the caterpillar as it details the caterpillar’s extreme hunger whenever it ate through so many food items. Eric Carle makes the story extremely cute and hilarious as the caterpillar literally eats twice its weight and I found myself laughing at the different types of food that the caterpillar ate. Many children will be awed at how much food the caterpillar, even I was surprised at how much food the caterpillar ate and I was not so surprised when the caterpillar had a stomachache, which will teach children about the importance of not overeating so much.</span>",...

I was so excited to find this story in board book format, so that we can read it repeatedly without worrying about tearing/bending the pages. The cardboard pages are thick and feature the holes through which the caterpillar ate. To make the story interactive, I made a small ""caterpillar"" out of pipe cleaners and as we read, she ""feeds"" him through the holes in the foods on the pages! It makes it so much more fun for her to read the story! The board book measures 7"" x 5"" and features the classic Eric Carle style tissue paper collage illustrations (note that is how he creates the look, there are no textured pages in this book).<br><br>The plot of the story takes you through the life cycle of a butterfly from egg to caterpillar to pupa to butterfly. I love how educational this story is and how perfect it is to initiate educational activities about butterflies with your child. We've read it so many times, but now that she's a bit older, we've created butterfly life cycle collages, done story sequencing activities with it, and we even purchased a live butterfly garden that allowed her to see how a real butterfly transforms <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterfly-Garden-Gift-Set-with-Live-Cup-of-Caterpillars/dp/B00WE1BKDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterfly Garden Gift Set with Live Cup of Caterpillars</a>.

It is so cute and colorful. Being a board book, it isn't something that will be torn or broken.  My 4 year old grandson came over.  We read it to him.  He loved it.  He actually was saying what was on the next page.  We thought maybe he was psychic until he said his preschool teacher read it to everyone.  He even showed the book around like the teacher did.  My daughter in law remembered it from when she was little.  This was one of her all time favorites.  It's about a caterpiller eating everything until he gets big and fat and turns into a butterfly.  The colors are nice.  It's cute that pages have holes in them showing how many things the caterpiller ate on that page.</span>",The Very Hungry Caterpillar...Very Cute!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHM66OUVAAKYCEWFUAF5O36J5EUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It's a classic and kids love it.  What I didn't realize from the picture, is that this particular board book is very large and has a handle which is integrated into the book.  It also comes with a small plush hungry catapillar which is nice when reading the story to use to demonstrate the catapillar eating his way through the food, not to mention perfectly sized for little hands.  I know the description states ""giant board book and plush package"" but again, the picture does not match the description so I was curious as to which item I would receive.  I was looking for a large board book without the handle, because the handle is not very sturdy and arrived bent/damaged.  I didn't bother contacting Amazon as with a few uses the handle will bend anyhow (and remain crinkled), hence the reason I was looking for a board book without the handle.  I am pleasantly surprised by the little plush though :)</span>",This book is HUGE!!!!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEMTNASSUJ5GNBB6EKFY6HL2C5HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

If you are looking to buy a book that has a classic story line and incredible artwork, this is the right book for you. I grew up reading this book so I knew for a fact that my two-year-old daughter would enjoy and appreciate this book just as much as I always have. If you are looking to buy this book, I would highly recommend that you purchase the board book version. The board book is much sturdier than the average hard cover or paper cover so it does not get easily damaged and destructed by a toddler. This is a fantastic book and story that never gets old. You will have no regrets when you order Eric Carle's classic tale of ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"".</span>",Timeless and Unforgettable Story for All Ages,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AENUTIITOPDMQJVW7EEXR56MAQEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The cycle of life, from egg, to caterpillar to cocoon and finally butterfly is taken step by beautiful step. Carle's gentle humor makes the insect a personality filled with wonder at his own growth. Reading it together, I love to build the tension until the ending , when the cocoon changes into a wonderful new creature. We have a new love for our flying friends now, and have even grown our own butterflies. It was as wondrous as reading this book.</span>",it became a great favorite in my grandson's library and we have read ...,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE3GRCJPL7IXD22AJODJBC6OGZDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

When thinking of what books I wanted to get him I thought back to what books I enjoyed myself as a kid. One of the top three booked that popped into my head was ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"". I have such fond memories of reading this book as a kid that! Such a cute story along with learning. The price I thought was very fair as I have seen it cost even more at Walmart. Shipping was quick (I didn't use two day shipping) and the packaging was great as well. The book itself was in excellent new condition and the sturdiness has held up strong against my 11 month olds roughness upon it. The colors are very vibrant and they really pop off the book! Definitely an A+ book that I would reccomend you adding to your little ones library! It would also make a great gift :)</span>",A childhood classic!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJ7QVO5ZVN4GIKNGW3R4QQW4R7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It is also very, very awkward to hold it open while reading because of the size, and also because it is simply hard to open. I have no explanation on why the book opens with difficulty.

I have adopted the tradition of buying classic children's stories and fairy tales to gift friends who are pregnant or have children of their own.  Because of the popularity and relatively unchanged look of this story, it is considered a classic and can be quite expensive in book stores (hence, me buying this on Amazon.com).  The book is available in several different formats but I always buy hardcover books for children as my hope is they will weather little hands.  It has 32 pages with several half, third, and quarter pages as the caterpillar begins to eat through fruits and vegetables; bright, colorful illustrations, and a bound bead-board white cover (note: this cover can get dirty quickly!).  The book is approximately 9"" x 12"" and has a wonderful message and story.</span>",Great for little hands that like to turn pages and interact with the story!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYREPVR7ATKNJ6LYUWGRDCBNC3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This book explains the life cycle of the butterfly and introduces children to the days of the week, the names of fruits, and numbers as the caterpillar eats through different foods each day --two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, etc.-- until he finally weaves his cocoon and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.We enjoy reading his books again and again and the story was easy to remember. Beautiful illustrations and great story. Yet there are some mistakes like on the ""Saturday"" page according to the text, the caterpillar ate through ""one slice of salami"", yet the picture shows that he eats through the entire salami, the butterfly he turns into has its wings upside-down and the butterflies comes from chrysalis not cocoons.The reason I rated this book a 5 stars is because this is a beautiful,educational,imaginative and fun book for little kids.

I've been reading this to my son since he was 1 year old and even at that age he enjoyed flipping through the pages and peeping through the little holes while looking at all the colorful pictures as I read it to him.</span>,Classic Board Book for Kids,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG5WW37ZUPPPIAKO5WATK3IUTI5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This copy was purchased for my cousin's baby shower and as a teacher she was beyond thrilled to receive it!  The book was a little smaller in size than I realized it would be when I initially ordered it, but it's actually the perfect size for little kid hands. This will probably become a tradition for me to buy as a baby shower gift from now on.

The story has bright colors, fun sensory holes for tiny fingers to explore, simple plot lesson on metamorpheses, counting, days of the week, nutrition moral and food identification. It's been a family favorite. I wanted to give some new moms this book as a gift (with cute stuffed caterpillars I found at Dollar Tree). I knew I'd find the best deal for the book on Amazon.com, so I took a risk ordering this smaller copy. It is small (slightly bigger than a dollar bill), but perfectly appropriate for the baby/toddler audience! It can become that special book that travels to the car, pack n play or fits in your purse for an errand.

What arrived was a little BOARD book (Yes it is hard but different to me than hardcover book.) and a tiny hungry caterpillar.  Knowing what the traditional, original hardcover book size is (11 1/2 x 8 inches), I thought that is what I was ordering.  Pictures don't tell you the true size unless you have something next to it that you know the true size of that object.  Therefore, I thought the caterpillar would be bigger.  I hesitate to rate this item low because it is fine for what it is but not fine for what I thought I was ordering.  For the amount I paid ($20.65) you would think it was the bigger book not the tiny (7x5) board book that I received.  The video that was included in the product description shows Eric Carle with the size of book in his hands that I thought I was ordering.  I should have been more careful because in the description it does say ""sturdy board book edition"" but in the title it says ""hardcover.""  I also should have read the reviews because they all said what arrived were smaller than expected.</span>",Hardcover not BOARDbook,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2GVCPQUUWQ5HNG6A47I24BRXUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I took a chance (since I'm overseas, I can't return it) and bought the Very Hungry Caterpillar Board Book w/ Plush Toy from Amazingsalebooks in used / like new condition for under seven bucks.  It is a gift for an expectant mother.  I am very happy with this purchase (see my pics).  Everything came in like new condition as the seller stated -a relief, because I was reluctant to buy used for a book and plush toy meant for a newborn.  Both were spotless, vibrant, and free of creases and markings).  Even the gift box it comes in came relatively uncrushed (after traveling in my friend's suitcase through three countries).  What I received appears to be a genuine Eric Carle product -the book I got is published by Philomel 1987 edition.  I saw reviews where people complained about the print, maybe it was for a smaller edition; I found the print here to be fine.  I would say it is about font size 16.<br><br>The book itself is cute and perfect to read for babies and toddlers (repetition teaching days of the week, numbers 1-7, fruits and other foods, and life cycle).  The colors are very vibrant and the book has all the little holes (about the size of a standard hole punch... you won't be able to stick your fingers through, which also means baby can't rip it).  It is a solid, sturdy, proper board book with smooth finished edges that I feel comfortable having a baby touch (or even if they suck on it before you notice and pull it out of their mouth).<br><br>The plush toy is also very well constructed with no loose seems and withstands gentle tugging on the ears, legs, and colored fringy hairs (of course you always need be careful with babies and choking on anything and not let them suck on this more than a moment or unsupervised).<br><br>Unrelated, I bought a cute Eric Carle baby rattle -see my other review if you are curious.</span>","Board Book (7"" x 5"") w/ Plush Toy - Used / Like New Review",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFPETT5Z27GB5M4HDWHE672ZYJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Do you know what caterpillars become?<br><br>The author, Eric Carle, has written one of the most interesting and fun books we have read. As you proceed through the book, you discover that the caterpillar is doing something interesting to the pages. As you begin, we discover on Sunday, the caterpillar breaks out of an egg, he becomes very hungry. On Monday he ate through an apple, on Tuesday three plums, and so on, until he has worked through the days of the week, and once he is finally full, he curls himself in a cocoon, and then magic occurs. Once you have read this story, you will discover what happens, and what is going on with the pages of the book.<br><br>Adults will enjoy reading this book to their children. The children will enjoy hearing about the caterpillar, and they will laugh when they see the book and the holes in the pages. The illustrations are bright, vivid and colorful, and depict the adventures of the caterpillar. The entire story is so much fun, and with the addition of the fun pages is exciting.

I recently read this book for the first time, when it ended up in the bag of books I must choose from when I read.  I VERY quickly found out that it is a very special book!  Child after child in both my afternoon and morning classes chose this book when it was one of the selected books of the day.<br><br>Kids in my classes tend to go for the board books, especially the younger ones.

I think it would have sufficed to say that he was no longer a tiny caterpillar or that he had grown up, rather than to say he was big and fat.

Charming colorful illustrations of foods along with the fat caterpillar and catchy little holes in the foods where the caterpillar ""had his snack"" make this book a hit with young children.<br>Review:<br>- Eric Carle's classic, ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" has charmed millions over the years with it's simple memorable story, striking illustrations and the gimmicky holes on each of its' pages. To date, more than 12 million copies of this book have been sold in its original, full-sized edition, and mini editions. This beloved tale of science and gluttony has also been translated into 20 languages and counting. Die-cut pages (each page has a hole where the ""caterpillar"" ate through the food item) illustrate what the caterpillar ate on successive days. Strikingly bold, colorful pictures and a simple text in large, clear type tell the story of a hungry little caterpillar's culinary progress through an amazing variety and quantity of foods. Full at last, he weaves a cocoon around himself and goes to sleep, to emerge a few weeks later as a wonderfully transformed and beautiful butterfly! The final, double-page picture of the butterfly is a joyous explosion of color, a vibrant affirmation of the wonder and beauty of Nature. This story is a hit every time.

Bush named as his ""favorite book"".  Ignoring the fact that the Mr. Bush was born in 1946 and the book was published originally in 1969, it's a good idea to reexamine ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" on the basis of its own merits.  It is the best known Eric Carle book by far and has remained a beloved text since the day it was conceived and published.<br><br>Here's the plot, inasmuch as there is one.  A caterpillar (make that a very HUNGRY caterpillar) proceeds to eat his way through an amazing and amusing assortment of fruits, sweets, and (in time) leaves.  After becoming quite a fat little fellow, the caterpillar makes a cocoon for himself and eventually emerges as a splendiferous butterfly.  The end.<br><br>I'm going to ignore the fact that as a child I found this book a bit repetitive.  We are told that children like to hear repeated phrases in books, and perhaps this is true.  From what I can recall, however, this book bugged me with its continually repeated, ""but he was still hungry""s.  Looking at it now, though, it is a lovely little work.  The caterpillar has far more expressions on his face than I initially remembered.  When he's searching for food he has a somewhat bewildered look in his eyes.  When he's eaten an amusingly large assortment of foods his eyes droop as he attempts to live through his own stomachache.  Oddly, the time he looks the most distressed is after he has turned into a beautiful butterfly.  Now his face is contorted in such a way that his drooping eyes and open mouth make him look as if he is crooning a sentimental sad ballad to the viewer.<br><br>To be frank, I'm not the biggest Carle fan in the world.  But he really was one of the forefathers of the collage picture book.  And though I might prefer some of his later book to the caterpillar, there's no denying that the book has had the kind of staying power most authors only dream of.  So by all means pull up a chair and take a gander at the very hungry caterpillar.  It's a nice tale that amuses and entertains even as it helps children to count.</span>",Muncha muncha muncha,

It is a delightful book and simple so children soon learn the words to use it as a pre-reader using picture clues for the words. It also teaches about the way a butterfly starts as an egg and ends up after two other steps a butterfly. A great children's book is one that meets many needs of the reader and The Very Hungry Caterpillar is one such book for young children.</span>",The Very Hungry Caterpillar,

They love the holes and the small pages throughout the story; those aspects of the book allow the story to be interactive with youngsters as it's being read.  I think that the illustrations are magnificent.  Eric Carle's use of bold colors and his technique in which the pictures are drawn, are what really make this book captivating.  Each time I would read this story to my children, they would notice something different, that might have been overlooked the previous time, and they would just be in awe!

One sunny Sunday morning a tiny and very hungry caterpillar pops out of an egg.  He starts to look for food.  On Monday, he eats through one apple; on Tuesday, he eats through two pears; on Wednesday, he eats through three plums; and so on and so forth for all the days of week.  On Saturday, the caterpillar eats through a bunch of things, including a piece of chocolate cake, one pickle, one lollipop, one slice of salami, and piece of cherry pie, and one slice of watermelon.  Not surprisingly, he gets a stomachache.  The next day is Sunday again.  The caterpillar eats a nice green leaf and feels better.  By now, he's a big, fat caterpillar, and he builds a cocoon around himself.  He stays inside for two weeks and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.  In addition to doing a great job with the metamorphosis story, the book does a nice job of teaching the days of the week and counting.  Also, my daughter loved sticking her little fingers in the hole-punched pages and turning them as we read.<br><br>One afternoon at the library, my almost three year old daughter spotted a Spanish version of The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  She was so excited.  She grabbed the book off the shelf and not realizing it was Spanish, she sat down and ""read"" it.

When a tiny caterpillar emerges from an egg on a leaf he is VERY hungry. On each day of the week, the caterpillar eats holes through every bit of food he finds—and through the actual pages of the book—and becomes a very fat caterpillar. After spinning a cocoon and resting within it for two weeks, the caterpillar emerges as a beautiful butterfly. The age old story is told with graceful simplicity: short, perfect sentences that convey a warm, lighthearted mood; and magical illustrations in easily identifiable but humorous shapes with an artistic melding of bright colors. A joy. There are lessons intrinsic in the tale, too. The days of the week form a progression children will learn and the food caterpillar eats is easily identified and could form the basis for counting. But one caveat: beware of the edition you purchase. Decide before you buy whether you want a pocket size (that might be hardcover and not really a board book) or a full size copy. Many choices are available through Amazon and thankfully, the story and illustrations remain the same across the spectrum.</span>",A classic of children’s literature and a favorite story to enjoy over and over again.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7YKA7W3L5OYF27D6BX2KQY3T5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Now, many of Eric Carle's books have gimmicks--the tactile web in  THE VERY BUSY SPIDER and the chirping in THE VERY QUIET CRICKET, for  example.  The gimmick in this book is that the caterpillar eats holes  through all the food, holes that are actually punched into the pages of the  book.  It's a good gimmick, actually.  Also, many of Carle's books teach  conventions--telling time in THE VERY GROUCHY LADYBUG and animal sounds in  THE VERY BUSY SPIDER, for example.  This one teaches the days of the week.  On Monday, the caterpillar eats this, on Tuesday he eats that, and so  forth.  Very cute.  Eventually, he becomes a fat caterpillar.  He then  spins himself a cocoon, where he rests for two weeks.  And when he  emerges...well, you can guess the results.  It's a wonderful story.  Best  of all, the text is very simple as are the illustrations, so the book will  appeal to toddlers as well as the pre-K and kindergarten crowd.  In fact,  it may appeal more to toddlers, because the story is so very simple.  I  know I read it as a kindergartener.  I loved the holes but found the story  rather boring.  I read it to my two-year-old this spring, however, and he  went nuts over it.  The days of the week were lost on him, but he was  fascinated by the caterpillar turning into a butterfly--he had no idea!  Can't tell you how many times we read it.  We also re-enacted it, crawling  on the floor and eating, spinning ourselves into cocoons, and popping out  with fluttery wings.  In fact, he was so taken with the  caterpillar-to-butterfly phenomenon that I ordered some caterpillars (I  used ""Insect Lore""--they are on-line--but I'm sure there are lots  of other places to get them).  We read THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR at each  stage of their development and then right before we released them as  butterflies.  It was the highlight of our spring.</span>",Perfect spring reading!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFUZIKXONJWYFCTI3ELAX5M5TPIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

At the end of the week he spins a cocoon and turns into a butterfly.  The book is not scary at all.  It introduces readers to the days of the week.  Unfortunately, the book isn't exactly accurate about the diet of caterpillars, since it shows the caterpillar eating salami and ice cream.  But you allow Carle to be creative with his caterpillar diet, it's worth the fun.  The page for each day of the week is a different size, and they all have holes in them, adding a multimedia dimension to the book.  All together, the book has about 200 words.</span>",Fun,

He builds a cocoon and then emerges a large beautiful butterfly.  My 3 year old does not tire of this story. He learns about nature, food and the days of the week in one absolutely stunningly illustrated book.  You can't get much better than this for young children.

This is a story that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  Through Carle's unique illustrations and die-cut images, the reader's attention is immediately grabbed when opening the first page to this fascinating story.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is also very educational.  The text teaches readers the process that a caterpillar goes through to become a butterfly.  It also teaches readers the importance of a healthy diet.<br><br>  Eric Carle has a great respect for children and their education. ""I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun"" (The Official Eric Carle Website). All of Eric Carle's books have a lesson that all children can learn from.  Carle has a very strong love for nature, and feels that it is important to communicate that to his readers.  Carle uses animals as characters for most of his books.  Many subject areas that are found in Carle's books include: Science, Math, Health, Reading, and Art.<br><br>  The Very Hungry Caterpillar story starts out in the middle of the night.  The caterpillar is only an egg sitting on a leaf.  One Sunday morning, a very hungry caterpillar popped out of the egg.  The caterpillar wanted to eat, and decided to look for some food.  Each day, the caterpillar eats more and more food.  Finally, the caterpillar becomes very big and fat, and decides to build a cocoon around him.  The caterpillar stayed inside the cocoon for more than two weeks.  Finally, he nibbled his way through the cocoon, and out came a beautiful butterfly.<br><br>The genre of The Very Hungry Caterpillar can be classified as fantasy since caterpillars do not eat the same foods that the very hungry caterpillar does in this story.  In the story, the caterpillar falls into a dilemma of his own when he gets too fat.  He then resolves this problem by building a cocoon and then forming into a butterfly.<br><br>  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is an example of a good piece of children's literature.  According to the temple text, a good piece of children's literature must expand awareness.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar teaches the readers about caterpillars and how they transform into butterflies. A good piece of children's literature must also provide an enjoyable read that doesn't overly teach of moralize.  In The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Carle tells an enjoyable story about a caterpillar and the funny foods that he eats.  While children enjoy laughing out loud to the caterpillar's eating habits, they are able to learn the importance of healthy eating.  This book is also full of quality.  Although it is not as poetic as Carle's other books, the plot is somewhat convincing, and the description is entertaining.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar shows a lot of originality as well.  We are not only able to see this through the text, but through Carle's vivid illustrations, and die cut holes.<br><br>  There are several classroom connections for The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  Science, counting, pattern sequences, and days of the week are all classroom connections found in this story.  As a teacher, you can explain to your class how the caterpillar transforms from an egg, to a caterpillar, to a butterfly.  Teachers can then have your students draw the steps out on a piece of paper.  Teachers can conduct a math lesson using the different foods that the caterpillar eats.  Teachers can even have their students create their very own Eric Carle Art.  There are so many different lessons that can come out of this wonderful story that children can benefit from.  Eric Carle books are a must have in every elementary school teacher's classroom.</span>",Literary Critique,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQAX7TLEMGXMUFCOYK2ZD3XVSCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The main draw is the holes in the pages which are just the right size for his fingers. The pages have holes punched in the food items that the caterpillar has eaten. He would regularly return to this book but lose interest once we got past the holes. It was a long time before we ever reached the ending. At that age, they will latch onto just about any book. I just don't find this book particularly interesting. Ezra Jack Keats would be a better choice for collage art. Try ""The Snowy Day"" or ""Peter's Chair"" to get started.

Many can remember it being read to them as children in school and at home.  Eric Carle dedicated the book to his sister.  This book is over forty years old.  Carle wrote it originally as a book about a worm but after talking to his publisher they decided on a caterpillar.  Carle loves colors and loves nature, and you can see that throughout this book.  It's brilliantly put together in a way that children can understand metamorphosis in a simple and interesting way.<br> I enjoy the way that Carle put together this book.  Kids love seeing the holes in the pages where the caterpillar has eaten through.  Children can relate to the way the caterpillar eats sweets, because when children eat too many sweets they get a bellyache, too.  In a small way the book works with basic mathematics as well.  As the caterpillar eats through things, it names ho many he has eaten. For example, ""On Thursday he ate through four strawberries, but was still hungry.""  With this you could have the child count the objects as you read.  From this quote you also notice that the book works with days of the week.  This is a good reinforcement for children just learning the days of the week.<br> Carle puts a kid-friendly voice to the book, so whether an adult reads it to children or a child reads it on their own it comes through as a similar voice.  I really enjoyed reading this book again.  It begins back memories of when I was a kid, and also reminds me of the simple beauty of nature.  In conclusion, I would strongly recommend this book to others of any age.</span>",Perfect Holiday Gift for Children!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGGUUVCZKYA7UGMCR2YZAZRG45Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The book was very appropriate for young readers because the story was very understandable. The text and illustrations were very simple which is appealing to children. There were only a few words on the pages that help to keep the attention of young children when reading aloud. The illustrations both in the story and on the cover of the book expressed the theme of the book, nature. The illustrations were humorous, children can interact with them and the illustrations went very well with the text. It made the story real and children are able to see and understand how the caterpillar feels in the story. The text is packed with lots of information as is other work by Carle. This text is similar to other books with the same theme or subject because it teaches children about, metamorphosis, nature, counting, days of the week and sequencing. Most of the authors' work teach concepts, conventions, relationships, and allow student to interact with the text The books are all filled with humor, very colorful and have bold illustrations which make the books similar.  Reviewers feel that this book is outstanding. Excellent for young children to engage in whether they try to read it or if it's read to them aloud. I must agree with reviewers, the understanding of the book and the exciting and bold colors used in the illustrations are creative and great. This book will indeed make a contribution to the growing body of children's Literature. This book will remain one of the top recommended and will last a lifetime.</span>",The very Hungry Caterpillar,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDTGSKXXJQWLZ66MW5GR2VRJAYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

We would look over my mother’s shoulder and watch her read the story and connect her voice with the words she was reading. Both I and my brother loved the story and the lovely colors that are displayed in this book. The colors and illustrations are very eye capturing giving the book a feeling of the images being painted on to paper. The pictures in the book set a feeling of delicacy, almost like a butterfly.<br>The main character of this book is a small caterpillar that hatched from an egg one day.  Once the caterpillar hatched, it grew hungry. It then began a voyage of eating excessively. After a week, the caterpillar became very fat and made itself a cocoon in which it slept in for two weeks. Once two weeks was reached, the caterpillar was no longer a caterpillar, but it transformed into a beautiful butterfly.<br>This book never really mentioned a setting, but to me, it seems to take place possibly in a park since on one of the pages (pg. 4) there is a group of random foods listed that wouldn’t really be found anywhere else. The books plot however is how the caterpillar was hungry and that it was trying to suppress its hunger. The climax of this story is when the Caterpillar grew fat and rested and then transformed into a butterfly. The rising action would be the days that the caterpillar ate and how much food it ate on those days.<br>A good thing that this book helps teach is how to count and the days of the week. “On Monday, he ate through one apple. But he was still hungry” (pg. 3). The book keeps this numerical sequence going, all the way till it reaches Saturday which is when the sequence becomes out of order. “On Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon” (pg. 4). For this to have stayed in sequence there would’ve only been seven foods listed instead of ten. Another thing that I think that this book teaches children is that even if you may find something negative about yourself, you are a beautiful person overall.<br>The pictures in this book are very vibrant and stand out. The colors pop off the page. The font of the book is somewhat large and bold, written in what looks like Times New Roman. As mentioned before, the book is in numerical order and in order from days of the week. It lists the food that the caterpillar ate before turning into a butterfly. I think that the bold words and the font size for this book worked out very well. It can help the children read the words, making the words stand out better. The images go along with the names of the food listed in order for the child to relate the word with the picture of the food. I think its cute how Mr. Carle (the Author and Illustrator) added holes going through the food items showing where the caterpillar munched on the items.<br>This book can relate to both young and older people in empowering them to recognize that regardless what you look like, you are a special person and that you do matter. That at the end of the rainbow and after all the hard work that you have done, it pays off at the end.</span>",Both I and my brother loved the story and the lovely colors that are displayed ...,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFE2JPUXCWDBHMHZKUY4UAS7QEGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It has everything a child could ask for when it comes to a grabbing story, creative illustrations, and it teaches your children what the days of the week are in a fun and different style from what most readers are accustom to.  Eric Carle is a brilliant writer and illustrator for his genre.  He has written over seventy children books but The Very Hungry Caterpillar is his most famous children’s book.  Since it’s publishing in 1969 it has been translated into sixty-two different languages and sold forty-one million copies.  I read this book as a child, as did many others, and I am still blown away by the extravagant illustrations.<br>This children’s book is nothing like anything you are use to.  Eric Carle is not a tradition author/ illustrator in the sense that he just writes the book, draws the pictures to coincide with the story and calls it a day.  Eric Carle uses everything in the book, including cutting pages to really get his message across and keep the reader/ children interested.  In The Very Hungry Caterpillar the pages start out the same length but then get very small and gradually get to back to the original size.  This helps keep the children’s attention.  As the pages turn you will see the Caterpillar climbing threw the holes in the food he just made and continue on to the next day.  The imagery in this book are breathe taking.  Eric Carle multiple forms of art to give his images life and make the pictures of food look appetizing.  This books express’s Eric Carle’s talents.<br>Along with teaching children the days of the week this book also teaches the stages of life of this caterpillar.  It starts out, “In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf” (Carle).  Before you eyes you will see this egg turn into a caterpillar.  The caterpillar will eat and eat until it is time to make a cocoon and sleep.  The climax of this book is in his cocoon, the caterpillar transforms, “he was a beautiful butterfly” (Carle).<br>For teachers/ parents who will read this book to their children, a creative activity would be to have your children make some Eric Carle styled art.  The kids will love the bright colors and getting their hands dirty.  Another fun/ educational activity is to get the kids caterpillars and have them watch as the caterpillar transforms from its larva form, to a cocoon and then finally a butterfly.  This will give the children a real life experience to relate to the book.  After reading this book teachers/ parents might want to ask the children if the understood theme of this book.  If they understood the growth of the caterpillar and that over time he changed similar to how over time, people will change.  Another question you might want to ask is if after hearing this story, do the children remember what the days of the week are.  Another activity a teacher/ parents can do it read some of Eric Carle’s other works, such as The Very Lonely Firefly or The Very Busy Spider.  Both are amazing books that will help support children in their early years.  The Very Lonely Firefly tells a story of a firefly that is lonely but eventually finds friends and The Very Busy Spider tells a tale of a spider who works very hard until her achieves his goal by completing his web.<br>For those who want to know more (children, parents and teachers) about Eric Carle and his work, a great place to look is his official website, http://www.eric-carle.com.  This will give readers a background to Eric Carle, his books and his museum.  Another great website to gather more information would be the museums facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/CarleMuseum/.  This website will give readers updates about his museum, books and other events related to Eric Carle.<br>The Very Hungry Caterpillar is Eric Carle’s best work.  You, your students/ children will truly enjoy it.  I’m sure that the hungry caterpillar will eat his way through the pages and into your heart as he did for me when I was a young child.</span>",The Very Hungry Caterpillar is an amazing children’s book,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3A3RLH4TIKXIX5RAXVGDYGC6KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The book is about a caterpillar that starts off from just and egg. Then, the caterpillar starts eatting a leaf. Then he starts to eat some fruits, and then more fruits. After he is done with that he gets to his sweets. For instance cake, pie, and ice cream. Even though he eats all of that he still eats another leaf. By this time the caterpillar is full and makes a cacoon, and then he turns in to a beautiful butterfly. The author Eric Carle always comes up with gimics for little kids in his books. For example, the book has holes in it so it appears the caterpillar is actually eatting. I recommend this book to the young. The older you get the cornyer it gets.

The story begins on Sunday, the caterpillar finds out that he is very hungry so he decides to eat a nice big green leaf. The next day he's still hungry so he eats a big red apple and this pattern continues throughout the rest of the week with various fruits while the number increases. On Saturday, he eats a variety of foods, starts to feel sick, and spins a cocoon. A few weeks later he emerges a beautiful butterfly. The book is filled with bright and colorful illustrations of the caterpillar's journey as he eats a different amount of food every day of the week. This book helps young children to learn the days of the week as well what happens to a caterpillar after it goes into its cocoon.

This book has all of the qualities of outstanding children’s literature. It expands awareness of how things can change in the world. Also, the book provides an enjoyable read that doesn’t overtly teach subject matter, like counting and identifying foods. Additionally, it tells the truth about overcoming obstacles and changes that may be faced, and it has a surprising amount of intelligent wording and poetic sounds. Furthermore, the colorful illustrations, well-expressed language, and tranquil style help develop the integrity of the book. Lastly, the book is extremely originally, down to the different length of pages, the holes in the pages to make what the caterpillar ate through, and the process of what it takes for a caterpillar to become a butterfly. This book is truly an outstanding piece of children’s literature.</span>",...

It is about a catapillar that is very hungryand it eats alot of food including apples, cake and even ice cream.I think kids will like this book because it has a catepillar and a butterfly in it and young children like bugs. It has a meaning that says dont judge a person by the way they look. It also tells children that real beauty is in the inside. This story has many pictures and it has a differnt stye of page that i think children of ages 3-8 will love it. Personally I think it is a wonderful book.

A young caterpillar is bornand begins to eat his way through the world and through many foods that you child will be able to identify. These foods are eaten on each of the seven days of the week, an added bonus, as your child begins to learn that Sunday is a different day that Monday. The caterpillar gets very fat. He builds a cocoon and then emerges a large beautiful butterfly. My 3 year old does not tire of this story. He learns about nature, food and the days of the week in one absolutely stunningly illustrated book. You can't get much better than this for young children. If you have young children, or if you are looking for a gift for a 4 year old and younger child, this book is highly, highly recommended.

It's no doubt that The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle is the best one. We like this book because it's more of a learning book then a lesson book. The Very Hungry Caterpillar helps kids learn the days of the week and how to count. It also teaches how caterpillars are supposed to eat leaves and how they become butterflies.<br>This book has 17 pages with little writing on each page witch makes it easy for kids to read. There is really no age group for this book, they have great points for little kids and younger youth. The book contains ascending pages that are also colorful that grab the kid's attention. Over all the The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a great book for younger readers.</span>",... had to read three children's books and pick our favorite.

It seemed harmless enough. A simple book about a caterpillar, whatever that is, and its quest for food. What could possibly be wrong with this book. Well I'll tell you. What this book doesn't advertise the persuasive abilities for power. It turns whoever reads this book into a maniac driven mad by the revelation of the idea of hunger. Hitler himself had read this, and was too terrified from what he had seen. Let me delve into more detail.<br><br>It was a sunny Friday afternoon, and I was at a pool party. This wasn't a party I was invited too, but I like kids, so I came anyways. The party was in celebration of some kid's 9th birthday party. Said kid was enjoying himself at the far end of the pool, while I hid in the shadows so no parents would notice I wasn't supposed to be there. I should probably say that this wasn't a public pool, but the parents' backyard. I would occasionally sneak some of the food that was laid out for the hungry kids, and maybe a soda or two.<br><br>Before long it was time for presents, and every kid came rushing to the table area. The parents' neglected to take the kid's baby brother with them to the party place, so he was sitting reading a book. This book. My curiosity got the best of me and I tiptoed over to the kid to see what masterful piece of literature it was he was reading. I quickly tried to snatch the book from the young sap's hands, but my manly grip was no match for his iron hold. I had to act quick so nobody else would see me. I grabbed the whole child and bolted over the nearest fence. I ran as fast as my heart could stand, and didn't stop to rest for several blocks.<br><br>After running a safe distance, I again tried to pry the curious read from the tough toddler's hands. Thankfully the crowbar I had worked just as well. With no more use of this child, I placed him on a nearby doorstep with a note attached reading ""Orphan Child. Please give good home."" and rang the doorbell. When someone came to the door, I had to explain the awkward situation, but they promised to do good by me. I was then able to prance home, guilt free, for a night of lavish luxury with my new companion, The Very Hungry Caterpillar.<br><br>This was the sort of book in which you only required two things to begin reading it. A nice, warm fleece blanket in which you rely on in times of hardship and cling to no matter what, and a literate mind. Luckily one of my servants knew how to read so one out of two isn't terrible. As I sat there, sprawled on top of my bed, covered in beautiful women, my mind began to absorb all that José was reading from the book. My mind tried to make sense of what was happening. This is what I gathered.<br><br>In the beginning, there was but Caterpillar. Caterpillar was hungry, but there was naught. So Caterpillar said ""LET THERE BE,"" and there was. Even though there was, Caterpillar was still hungry, and so there is. Caterpillar could never stop hungering. From an objective viewpoint, this was a problem. Caterpillar realized this problem and so became. It seemed finally that Caterpillar was no longer hungry.<br><br>And so, as the story develops we manage to learn that Caterpillar is always hungry, and that always being hungry isn't a bad thing. Hunger is what drives us, making us ourselves. Without hunger we are only us, never I. All Caterpillar wants is more, but there never is more. More will never be, even though it is all we want. There is no more, just all there is.<br><br>As I laid there, wedged between bodacious babes, my puny mind tried to process all this information. Then, the inevitable happened. I could feel them coming from miles away, but never thought that I would be unlucky enough to be affected. My mind blanked. All I could see was colors. At this point I was pretty sure I started screaming, because that's when all the gorgeous women ran, panicked. José stayed.<br><br>My body felt separate, but connected. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was happening, because I couldn't feel my fingers. My body stretched, which if you were watching, might seem cool. I could feel the pigments in my skin change from blue, to purple, to green, back to skin color, then back to green. My entire being started convulsing, my body splashing around like a beached aquaman. If only I had listened to Caterpillar.<br><br>It was time. The transformation was almost complete. My head turned from a round shape into an even rounder shape. My arms became nonexistent as they turned into small, stubby feet. My legs shrank into my pelvis, which extended into smaller joints. I wriggled around. I am no longer me. I am now Caterpillar.<br><br>Then I remembered I don't have a servant named José.<br><br>I woke up.</span>",There Is Only Caterpillar,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFBTAOHZFYDY5OHRALUWBY3SXIKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This one brought back memories of carefree summer days as a child, how exciting it was to find a caterpillar outside, to feel that little tickley sensation as it would move up my arm, and being amazed when my mother told me it would one day become a butterfly!  I'm so pleased with this little board book that uses the life stages of a butterfly - from egg to caterpillar to cocoon to butterfly - to teach counting, colors, days of the week, foods (not to mention a recipe for a stomach ache!) - very sturdily constructed, brightly illustrated, and at 7"" x 5"" and a hair less than an inch thick, it'll fit perfectly into the chubby little hands of our two year old little guy on his birthday!<br><br>The different sized pages in the middle of the book (after the caterpillar pops out of his egg on Sunday morning) showing different foods with holes punched in the centers to indicate where he's nibbled through them are darling - each page is thick enough that I think I'm going to cut a caterpillar-sized piece of green pipecleaner to give him so he can watch his very own caterpillar making its way through the one red apple he eats on Monday, two green pears on Tuesday, three purple plums on Wednesday, four red strawberries on Thursday, five bright orange oranges on Friday, and then the variety of multi-colored foods (probably not a caterpillar's scientifically accurate diet, but fun!) he eats on Saturday that leads to his stomache ache - chocolate cake, ice cream cone, pickle, Swiss cheese, salami, lollipop, cherry pie, sausage, cupcake and watermelon - goodness gracious!<br><br>On Sunday, he limits himself to one green leaf, builds his ""small house, called a cocoon, around himself"", stays in there for over two weeks before he emerges as a multi-colored butterfly, whose wingspan takes up the final two pages!  Though we probably won't expect our grandson to comprehend the scientific term of metamorphosis, he'll certainly grasp that the caterpillar's transformation is magical - a pretty good description of the book itself!</span>","Darling little board book uses the ""magic"" of the metamorphosis story to teach in a fun, simply-worded way",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGP47FFUKLGS6KCYZ4VWY6EZ5VMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This book has definitely helped him a lot to be motivated to try to eat more. We tried to feed him the foods that he is able to eat that match the book and ask him if he also wants to eat with catipilar and he will eat 80% more that way. We leave one sentence out when we read to him...the part about feeling sick/too full. He always asks for more food and more catipilar now. It's not a book that he just allows us to read once and be done. The pages are easy for little fingers to turn due to the varying sizes. He tries to poke his fingers in the holes but they're getting too big to fit which is a good thing. Sometimes he will try to look through the holes too.

We were all fascinated by this colorful book about a caterpillar who eats his way through a lot of food, then becomes a butterfly. Until the last couple of months, I hadn't picked up the book since 1990. But when I saw it at the store, I got it off the shelf to read to my daughter, and see if she liked it as much as I did then. Sure enough, she did. This is just a charming little book. It might not be much of a story book for bed time or anything, but it's definitely a neat one to look at.<br><br>The book is just a few pages long, but it tells the short story about a hungry little caterpillar who isn't satisfied when he eats a lot of fruit, so he moves on to snacks and what most people consider junk food, which makes him huge. The caterpillar then makes its cocoon, and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.<br><br>This book is for very young children, as you can see by the reading level in the product details here. It's best for babies to pre-schoolers, though it was quite fine with a kindergarten class too. Unless you're in an area that has a lot of caterpillars and butterflies, some kids aren't exposed to them much or know that caterpillars tun into butterflies, so this is a great book to show that. And like I stated above, the artwork is fantastic. Eric Carle has a very distinct style, going with tissue paper rather than pencil, ink or paint. Simple things like a hot dog or plum look great in their own right with this style, and even now as a hopeful children's book author, I admire this artwork. I also love how the caterpillar shows no emotion, except for when its eaten too much and you can tell he has a pretty bad tummy ache.<br><br>But there is one thing that's throwing off a lot of people who order this book, and it's the same thing that happened to me with The Very Busy Spider. Only in the product details do you see the size of the book listed. Most people would assume that these books are your more regular book size, rather than a mini version that fits in your back pocket. Sometimes the edition of the book isn't mentioned in the item title either, so please read the product details before placing an order so you don't end up disappointed when a tiny book arrives.<br><br>The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a book that most children will enjoy, and is a nice one to look at in the car, grocery shopping, or as a prep for a bigger bedtime book. Eric Carle just has that magic touch of making simple, short stories that are memorable for years to come...with a big help from colorful tissue paper!</span>","A classic for kids to enjoy, just read the fine print.",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKO6UJCEVUMJVBSZF2K2E5E5XXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

We have the board book version that my toddler received for Christmas over a year ago. It was read many times a day by tiny and over eager hands. No book, even a board book, can withstand that kind of enthusiasm. After numberous repairs, we decided to buy a second copy. It is just as loved, but it holding up better, I think because the kids are just a little bit older and have a better understanding of proper book care. We still read this book almost daily, though mostly from memory at this point. My 3 year old can recite it from cover to cover without even looking at the pictures. We love the story of all the different foods the caterpillar eats to feed his insatiable appetite and we only recently discovered the sad little face on the caterpillar after his feast on Saturday. This book is perfectly paced for a infant to preschooler and the colorful illustrations are eye catching even to adults.</span>",Best Eric Carle Book Ever.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBF4AZSMZVTDAU6TW4SBV2G4ZGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Their favorite part is the one where the caterpillar eats through 10 different kinds of food.  In fact, they always fight over it.

But now he's a big, fat caterpillar and spins himself a cocoon and ultimately pushes out at a butterfly!<br><br>The illustrations of the foods he eats his way through each have hole in the page and my little two-year old relative happily pushes his finger into each hole and is learning to count.

The language is quite simplistic. It sort of tells the story of the life cycle of a butterfly, but a little bit more poetic than that, with an additional segment that clearly is intended entirely to teach children colors, the days of the week, and how to count to five. But kids love those little die-cut holes!<br><br>I find Eric Carle's art style weird. ""The pictures are collages of specially prepared papers."" Apparently a new edition was released in 1987 with ""entirely new illustrations, similar to, but not exactly like, the original ones."" Odd. I own the board book version of this, which was given to me as a gift. I suppose I should really say I own pieces of this book, as they have torn it apart. It's one of those books that kids ask you to read over and over, but will start to grate on you after a while.<br><br>And there are some inaccuracies in this book, as far as the biology goes. For one, caterpillars don't eat random things. In fact, many of them don't eat anything except the plant type that they were born on. For example, the caterpillar of a monarch butterfly exclusively eats milkweed. Definitely no cheese and meat. But of course the Saturday page is really interesting to toddlers. My son learned the words for every single item on that page long before he could form complete sentences. But I have no idea what he thinks caterpillars eat. That section can be chalked up to ""poetic license,"" though. The most egregiously inaccurate part is that butterflies come from chrysalises, not cocoons. And in researching this, I found that there's a big difference between a chrysalis and a cocoon, namely that a cocoon is made from silk spun by the caterpillar (which then turns into a moth inside), whereas a chrysalis actually the caterpillar itself. So the larvae of moths (and other insects) spin cocoons, but the larvae of butterflies become chrysalises. The point being that if a caterpillar spins a cocoon, it's gonna turn into a moth. I know moths aren't as well-thought of as butterflies, and they tend not to be as brightly-colored, but Carle really needs to get his insects straightened out. Especially since he has so many books about them. When I would read this book to my child, I would actually change the words so that the end said, ""Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and... he was a beautiful moth!""<br><br>And someone else pointed out to me that the butterfly wings are on upside down. He's not an airplane, he's a moth-- butterfly-- whatever. Butterfly and moth wings are wider on the top and narrower on the bottom. So either his wings are upside-down, or his whole body is upside-down in the picture and what everyone thinks is his head is actually his butt.<br><br>Message: Caterpillars turn into butterflies?<br><br>For more children's book reviews, see the drttmk website.</span>","Don't know much about biology.

Charming colorful illustrations of foods along with the fat caterpillar and catchy little holes in the foods where the caterpillar ""had his snack"" make this book a hit with young children.<br>Review:<br>- Eric Carle's classic, ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" has charmed millions over the years with it's simple memorable story, striking illustrations and the gimmicky holes on each of its' pages. To date, more than 12 million copies of this book have been sold in its original, full-sized edition, and mini editions. This beloved tale of science and gluttony has also been translated into 20 languages and counting. Die-cut pages (each page has a hole where the ""caterpillar"" ate through the food item) illustrate what the caterpillar ate on successive days. Strikingly bold, colorful pictures and a simple text in large, clear type tell the story of a hungry little caterpillar's culinary progress through an amazing variety and quantity of foods. Full at last, he weaves a cocoon around himself and goes to sleep, to emerge a few weeks later as a wonderfully transformed and beautiful butterfly! The final, double-page picture of the butterfly is a joyous explosion of color, a vibrant affirmation of the wonder and beauty of Nature. This story is a hit every time. Carle's bright colors and clever die-cut artwork never cease to entertain even the youngest child, and there is surely nothing in nature closer to magic than the emergence of a butterfly. This is a beautiful, educational and fun book.<br>Literary Features For Young Readers:<br>- Simple words appropriate to pre-readers, younger children and ELLs (English Language Learners).<br>- The predictability of the words and their tie-in with the illustrations makes the book easy for pre-readers to understand.<br>- The rhythm of the prose makes the book memorable and fun book to read for little people.<br>- Strikingly bold, colorful pictures tell the story of the hungry little caterpillar in complement with the simple words.<br>- Eric Carle's art gimmick (i.e. the die-cut holes through the food illustrations on each page) gives small children (and the occasional adult like me!) an extra bit of fun and enjoyment<br>- The moral lessons of the story are simple and universal: ""Don't judge a person by the way they look"" and  ""real beauty is more than skin-deep.""<br>Teaching Tie-ins:<br>- Counting skills (Foods accumulate progressively)<br>- The days of the week.<br>- Nutrition (The best food for the caterpillar is the leaf, not the candy, cake, etc. or why we can't eat chocolate and candy all day long)<br>- Intro to science and biology:<br>It is a fun book with its' ""holes"" that have been eaten through the pages, and become a preschoolers introduction to science/biology when the little caterpillar turns into a beautiful butterfly.<br>- Shapes (foods)<br>Possible Projects:<br>- Food or nutrition mobiles and other related projects.<br>- Art collages in the style or Eric Carle using torn tissue and other media.<br>- Simple life cycle science projects (posters are life cycle mobiles)<br>- Caterpillar art activity: creating caterpillars out of an egg cartoons.<br>- As a preschool and kindergarten teacher, I had classes perform simple plays for young children based upon this book.<br>-----------------------------------------------<br>I highly recommend this charming little book for younger children and ELLs (English Language Learners).<br>Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan</span>",Charming � Eat Your Way Through An Afternoon!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWMCMJZERRJPRHKBTWYUEJ5N4SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

A  seemingly simple thought that occurred to me while reading a bedtime story to my two year old son . It resulted in two 3+ hour sessions, late into the night, adopting and abandoning multiple trains of logic/methodologies.  It required re-learning high school mathematics and analyzing the two dimensional pages of a great children’s book to assess the  three dimensional volume of illustrated food.<br><br>Read and enjoy the below, because I am never getting that six 6 hours of my life back.<br><br>Plus, my son's picture of Eric Carle's wonderful creation!<br><br>Methodology: Assuming our caterpillar eats approximately his own body’s circumference through the items’ width/thickness (a simple caterpillar-sized tunnel through the food), I used pi and math to determine volumes of the foods and the size and volume of an average man and likely caterpillar.  I reviewed the size, shape, of each food item in the book as well as the location and angle from which the caterpillar purportedly burrowed.<br><br>Result: The Very Hungry Daderpillar would eat (conservatively) 700 apples,1100 pears, 2100 plums, 3500 strawberries, 3600 oranges, 500 pieces of chocolate cake, 1300 ice cream cones, 1100 pickles, 3000 slices of swiss cheese, 6000 slices of salami, 6000 lollipops, 1400 slices of cherry pie, 1100 sausages, 700 cupcakes, 1000 slices of watermelon.<br><br>More data here: [...]</span>","How much would a person eat, if he ate the equivalent of the Very Hungry Caterpillar?",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH5JKP76OHWAL3UJTDKPHC3LV7BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The fascination is on all levels and we have managed to grow and develop the theme over the years.<br><br>Firstly when they were very young the food illustrations were great fun for them - and the holes in the pages where the caterpillar had 'eaten' through, were also great fun - they would look back and forth from one side to the other.<br><br>You can use the items to count up, quite basic, but a great learning tool for pre schoolers and for basic addition.<br><br>We have started raising monarch butterflies and this story has been a great basic primer for the life cycle. We watch Monarchs lay their eggs, although we have never seen a caterpillar hatch(yet) we have watched them right through growing, forming the chrysalis and hatching into a butterfly - it is such a good book to use as an easy and fun reference for early understanding of the cycle - and then showing them that it actually happens.<br><br>I love the illustrations. My only quibble is the butterfly at the end, well the wings seem to be upside down - the smallest wings are at the top of the butterfly, not the bottom. A small issue not really anything much - the rest of the book is so beautiful - I have other Eric Carle books, including a wonderful one on the cricket in a board book. I would recommend them for early primers - bright, bold colours and shapes, with lots to look at and lots to do in them.</span>","Excellent book, can be interactive, lovely illustrations, fascinating",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPKVLPDNVH5FTWFWEDLP3T4C6MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

So I thought it would be fun to buy a famous book like this, and I bought it a couple months ago. Now, I'm not much of a book reader, but I gotta say, I could not put this book down! It's a nice story about a catapiller that has lots of suspense in the middle, when he gets stuck in the cocoon. Who are the bad guys who trapped him in the cocoon??? You have to read it to find out.  It also has some magical ""science fiction"" stuff where (SPOILER ALERT!) the catapiller escapes from the cocoon and somehow turns into a butterfly. That was a plot twist that really caught me by surprise!<br><br>This book is sturdy, and has pages made of nice thick cardboard. So it's perfect for me to bring on the bus to read on my way to work. Now, I've got a question for all you ""Hungrey Catapiller"" fans out there: is this supposed to be a comedy book? Because whenever I read it on the bus, people around me look at the book, then look at me and start to laugh, like there's a ""inside joke"" in the book. But I never thought it was a funny book, just a suspenseful mystery. Maybe I just don't get the jokes, I guess.<br><br>Anyway, I recommend this book to readers of all ages! Even when my daughter comes to my house on her court-ordered visitation, she will pick up the Hungrey Catapiller book and understand some of it. She likes it almost as much as her coloring books. So it appeals to Kids, too.<br><br>I wish I could give this book more than ""5 Stars""! I also wish I could feed the Catapiller, so he wouldn't be so hungry anymore.</span>",Fun For All Ages!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNKNNRD3ALKA6LTXQD7ZPFA3AJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Pictures in The Very Hungry Caterpillar are bright, colour-filled, textured, imaginative, and spectacular!

As a result, the caterpillar becomes very fat and he gets sick  from all that food - until he nibbles on a leaf, and only then he feels much better. On the last pages caterpillar spins himself into a cocoon and soon he turns into a beautiful butterfly!<br><br>The predictable words, rhymes and rhythm are fun as well as educational: kids can learn about nature, shapes and types of foods, counting, and days of the week. The book also stands out with bright colors and clever die-cut artwork (each page has a hole where the caterpillar ate the food item). Also the pages progress in size which makes it fun for a child.<br><br>Overall, this book brings a sense of wonder and amazement to kids as they see metamorphose from the egg to the caterpillar to the cocoon and eventually to the beautiful butterfly.

The following Sunday he spins a cocoon and goes to sleep, waking as a beautiful butterfly.  This wonderful book has a lot going for it: It utilizes the days of the week, counts from one to five, names a number of familiar foods, and traces the life cycle of a caterpillar.  It also incorporates a charming humor when on Saturday, the caterpillar eats many foods beloved by small children (but not by caterpillars), and develops a stomachache.  There is also a tactile element for younger readers, because as the caterpillar eats through each food he leaves a hole in the page, which is a cutaway revealing additional foods to come on the next day.  The plot is simple enough to hold the attention of the toddlers for whom it is intended, while providing enough complexity to last longer than most toddler stories.  It's brightly illustrated in Carle's inimitable collage style.<br><br>Because of its immense popularity, the book has appeared in many editions -- including board book, paperback, foam book, and pop-up.

As the caterpillar searches for food and tries to satisfy his hunger, Carle combines the days of the week and counting so that little ones are learning as they follow the hungry caterpillar.  On Monday, he ate through one apple - and there is a hole in the apple!  On Tuesday, he ate through two pears - and there are holes in each of the two pears...and so on and so forth.  Finally, after continuously eating various foods throughout the entire week, the little catepillar has a stomach ache and eats through a leaf and feels better.  Then he spins his little cocoon and becomes a beautiful butterfly.  The colors are bright and add to the beauty of both the caterpillar and the butterfly.

On Friday, he eats through five oranges. But on Saturday, when he has a giant picnic feast, he gets more than a hunger pain.<br>No matter what, this has been one of the first books we all read as toddlers. They will love its artful looks, the holes in the books, and the early lessons. They'll learn the days of a whole week, counting from 1-5, and how to eat healthy and not eat too much unhealthy food.

Eric Carle is one of my and I'm sure a lot of other people's all time favorite authors.  His books are all so bright and fun.  I like how this book has fictional and factual information.  For instance, it tells how the caterpillar starts out in an egg, then eats, geting fat, then spins itself a cacoon, turning into a butterfly.  The fictional part is that it says how it eats through all of this junkfood such as:  cake, pie, ice cream, a lollipop, ect.  That part right there is what makes it so fun.  It's not every day that you hear about a caterpillar eating all of those kinds of things.  I think that the pages are set up so cool.  There's holes punched through all of the things that he eats so that it really gives you the feelig that he really ate through it.  This book makes children excited about reading because it's so much fun.  I think that this is one of the best books out there that you can find.

When you get to the page describing what the caterpillar first ate, which is ONE apple, the next pages are also being shown. The page with the one apple is only about 1/4 the size of the whole book, and sizing only gradually increases through the next pages as the caterpillar eats more fruits-- I hope I'm making sense so far-- so now, you have an apple printed on a 1/4 size page, then the next page, with two pears, is the size of half a page, and so forth. Because this is the layout, when you are looking at one apple, you are also looking at the pear, then the plum,  then the strawberry and then the orange.  So when I read it to my two year old, I say ONE APPLE, and good thing he knows what his fruits are otherwise if your child is not aware of the names of the fruits yet, it will be confusing for them to hear ONE apple yet see three or four fruits on what is technically one page. Because I do not want my toddler to get his numbers or fruits mixed up, I literally use my arms to cover the rest of the fruits when I am saying ONE apple, and then turn the page and use my arms again to cover the rest of the fruits when I say TWO pears, and then onto the page with the THREE plums; this way, he is able to identify the name ""apple"" with what is actually an apple, and not the pear or plum, and the actual number with the actual quantity of fruit that is shown on the page.<br><br>This is an awesome book, but the way this particularly copy is made is extremely inferior to the original.

It is shocking then to learn that over 6% of individuals dealing with anorexia and over 1% of individuals battling bulimia are in fact, male. Boys too, it seems, are dieing to be thin. In his book The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Eric Carle addresses the roots of male eating nervosa from parental abandonment to the growing ""hunger"" for love and acceptance. He addresses the patterns of binge and fast that so aptly marks the male patterns of this disease while addressing the ever looming image of bodily perfection, ""the beautiful butterfly.""

The fact that it is a tiny book suits his little hands even better.  I remember reading the same story but from the regular-sized book to him  and he was barely interested - perhaps it has something to do with not  being able to have a full view of the pictures with colours filling up most  of the page.  This is not the case with his tiny book as the tiny pictures  filled the tiny pages very nicely.  I would recommend this book as an  effective means to stirring a child's interest in books and reading.  I  know that for my son this book is and will be his all time favourite.

(I was lucky to be given an advance reader’s copy). It’s the story of Winston Churchill’s first days in office, beginning in May, 1940, when he formed a coalition government with Labour, to lead Britain. There have been plenty of books about Winston Churchill but Erik Larson puts his own spin on this oh-so-important period of history.<br><br>But if Winston Churchill is the main character in the book, Larson has a wide ranging cast of supporters, including his wife, Clementine, his children (including his fascinating daughter-in-law, Pamela Digby), other government officials, and, of course, the British people, who faced down months of the German Blitz in 1940 and 1941. Larson does his regular meticulous job of research and the book is a reader’s delight. I was going to write “a history reader’s delight”, but then I realized that Larson’s writing transcends classification and appeals to so many more readers than a typical history does.</span>",Another great Larson...,

Even the words Churchill used to help save democratic civilization have become cliches: “Their finest hour”, “Blood, sweat and tears”, “Never have so many owed so much to so few.”<br><br>Given that libraries could be filled with volumes dissecting almost every angle of Churchill’s life and WWII, it’s hard to imagine that Erik Larson could offer anything particularly original.<br><br>He has chosen, however, not to emphasize the extensive scholarship on this era, but to use journals and other primary sources to retell the Battle of Britain as it appeared to those in Churchill’s immediate circle. Thus, we get details as various as teenage Mary Churchill’s love of dances juxtaposed with his pet scientist’s ability to explain radar technology in a way he could understand.<br><br>These personal portraits, drawn from contemporary sources, combine to form a unique saga of what it felt like to be around Churchill in this troubled era.  Accomplished with real brilliance, I thoroughly enjoyed Larson’s narrative.<br><br>Personal taste for this kind of history will, obviously, differ. Should history be recounted with more ample reference to other scholars?  Does the personal inform the world-historical as much as Larson suggests?<br><br>These are questions which ultimately have to be answered by every reader. But, to my taste, this technique was an immense success in shedding new light on this dark, but inspiring era, in human history.</span>",What’s Well-Known becomes New When Retold as Personal Saga,

Colville was watching the bombs burst on London one night during a Luftwaffe attack). The book examines the first year Winston Spencer Churchill (1874-1965) served as prime minister from May 10, 1940 to the following May. During that momentous period the British suffered fifty-seven nights of bombing by Goering's vaunted Luftwaffe flying to Britain from their bases in Northern France and Belgium. In addition to his public role we see and become acquainted with Churchill's family especially his eighteen year old daughter Mary. We also meet his daughters Diana and Sarah who was wed to the entertainer Vic Oliver (whom Churchill did not care for). Winston's son Randolph was recently read to the beautiful Pamela but was unfaithful to her. Randolph had a serous drinking problem and served in the 4th Hussars and as a member of the British House of Commons. We even meet Churchill's big cat Nelson (named after Lord Nelson). During the momentous year of 1940 we see Churchill wooing US President Franklin D. Roosevelt as he fought to get Lend-Lease through the Senate. Americans were isolationistic in belief until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 catapulting into the war on an active bases as Britain's greatest ally. Churchill enjoyed good friendships with Lord Beaverbrook his air minister and good advisor Professor Lindemann among many others.<br>  This is not dry history! Larson writes like a novelist but his book is backed up by years of research. The reader gets to know the figures in the book and to care for their fates. England was a brave nation as in their finest hour they faced the horrors of the Nazi menace with great courage and determination to never surrender. Anyone who is interested in Churchill, World War II or history in general will profit from this excellent book. This is the kind of book which could well get a young person hooked on history! Kudos to Erik Larson!</span>",The Splendid and the Vile is a great historical examination of Churchill  during the blitz,

The result is a schizophrenic mix of dreamy romance and figures of blood and gore.  Both his female and male protagonists wear the hearts on their sleeves, while ever ready to switch partners. Larson projects himself into the minds of many actors, including Churchill, but his portrayal of Mary’s childlike, naive romantic notions are and Pamela’s serial adulteries are the most annoying sections that crop up continually throughout the book.<br>Clearly there is factual information here about the Second World War, especially from the British perspective. Churchill and the major figures are also documented in their historical and personal roles. Churchill appears as a virtual sociopath in his total disregard for the sensibilities of those who come in contact with him.  His willingness to impose his personal habits on others was disrespectful at best.<br>Readers who have not read more authoritative works will find the narrative informative, but may be frustrated by the structure of the book in many snippets, separated by longer fragments which seem to end in cliffhangers, designed to propel the material forward.<br>I suggest a new cover with a semi-naked man clutching a similarly deshabilled damsel to his manly chest, surrounded by the wreckage of a bombed-out home.

Lately, he's been slipping. And this one is simply phoned in. It reads like a cut and paste job. Larson found a bunch of letters and diaries from people around Churchill and interspersed snippets from them among bombing raids. Or so it seems. There is no real narrative. The story seems to be ... Churchill got handed an impossible job when he became Prime Minister, the Germans were really bad people who kept bombing England, many of those around Churchill seemed to be having a merry time while everyone else got bombed, and Churchill managed to get Roosevelt into the war (with the help of the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor). Sorry for ruining the plot but that's it. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Mr. Larson, please get back on your game and give us something like Devil in the White City again.</span>",There is nothing splendid about this book,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFF7F6ELAB3NMWJJI7SITLQ527GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

While the story was good, I thought the history was only fair. It was sometimes more like a combination of history with a dash of British Tabloids than pure history. Mary Churchill's love life, while it may be important to some, seemed a bit out of place in a book dealing with Churchill's struggles both domestically and against Nazism. The same could be said for Jock Colville and Pamela Churchill's romantic trials.  One glaring omission was the Halifax's peace initiative during the summer of 1940, which had the potential to topple the Churchill government and change the outcome of the war. No mention was made of this crisis and the little we read about Halifax is that he toured some bombed areas and was packed off to Washington to become ambassador.  Overall a good non-fiction book, but not one of the best history books I've read on the subject.</span>","Fair History, Good Non-Fiction",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQ44B5PYAYVR3ALFDHX4OUCAA3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It is a wonder how anyone at all survived at all during the attacks from Hermann Goring's air force with the author going into vivid detail with his description of the attacks.  Goring was totally frustrated with Great Britain's refusal to surrender.<br><br>Author Erik Larson also includes numerous characters besides Winston Churchill in the book with other family members and associates and the roles they played.  Anthony Eden, Averell Harriman who's wife called him ""a cheap old bastard"", wife Clementine Churchill and children, and, of course, President Franklin D.

This new one about Churchill during his first year as Prime Minister, which includes Hitler's invasion of England (the Blitz), is no exception. I have read a lot of and by Winston Churchill, including the full 8-volume biography as well as more than 1/2 of the companion document volumes that go along with it, so i am no stranger to Churchill. I consider him to be the greatest figure of the 20th century. Larson's current book has enthralled me with its mix of Churchill and the people surrounding him, in various ways, including Roosevelt, Hitler, Colville his secretary and various other British government officials. It hooks you from the first page and doesn't let up.

The answer to both questions was a resounding YES.<br><br>Mr. Larson has written a very engaging book about Churchill, his family (both private and official) and England during the first years of WWII, before America’s entry. He succeeds in painting a descriptive picture of the challenges England faced, including the fall of France, the Dunkirk evacuation, material and weapons shortages (including RN ships and RAF fighters), the very real fear of German invasion, the Battle of Britain, and the subsequent non-stop bombing of London and other cities. Along the way, Larson gives us very fine sketches of some of the principle actors, including Churchill himself, his wife “Clemmie” and his children, Lord Beaverbrook, King George VI and FDR emissaries Harry Hopkins and Averell Harriman, depicting not only their great strengths but also their foibles—some of which, including Churchill’s nakedness at certain times in certain places—make for very entertaining reading.<br><br>While this is not a comprehensive history of WWII, or anything approaching a complete biography of Churchill, it does portray a very dramatic, desperate time and how the British people and some of their leaders managed to endure and, in some cases, enjoy it.</span>","Even if you know a lot about Churchill and WWII, this is definitely worth the time.",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIO7HNVQSDLCEWJZ5CQSKT72VIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Churchill of course is front and center, Lord Beaverbrook, who ramped up production of aircraft, Averill Harriman, Roosevelt’s proxy and Pamela Churchill’s lover at 21 (and wife at 51) and others.  The author had access to the private diaries of some of the fringe players, such as Mary Churchill, Winston’s daughter, which gave the reader a sense of life among the upper classes while Britain was being destroyed by the Luftwaffe (and it was a very good life indeed.) I rate the book 3 stars because of its focus on the bombings, which became tedious, and the private lives of the Churchill coterie.

It could be considered a companion to In the Garden of Beasts. Whereas that volume covered the lead-up to WWII from the perspective of the US ambassador to Germany, in this one we are immersed in the Battle of Britain as experienced by Churchill, his family and entourage. The author seems to have developed an admiration for Churchill while researching the WWI saga of the Lusitania for Dead Wake, and here he gives full vent to it.<br><br>This bias is not a weakness of Larson’s work, it is part of his genius: he brings history to life with the character development, drama, and pacing of a novel. As usual, the detail is astoundingly meticulous, as is the footnoting. Wisely, he collects these at the end, referenced by page number so as no to distract form the narrative flow in the text. But as he hints in the Acknowledgements, these notes sometimes amount to a bonus with juicy easter eggs hidden within.<br><br>The other device that makes this story, like the others, such a page-turner, is that it uses a chronological, diarized format. It follows events throughout the first year that Churchill is Prime Minister, and we are hearing the voices of those who were at the centre of it all. In case you are worried that all the death and destruction will be to too much to bear, it is interwoven and leavened by the romantic carryings-on of many in the cast, particularly Mary Churchill, Winston’s  youngest daughter. Some of this can border on salacious, as no extra-marital affair seems to go unmentioned. Who knew there was so much shagging going on as the bombs dropped? In the end, that is part of what makes this whole saga inspiring: how ordinary people were able to cope with extraordinary, relentless adversity, and embrace life.</span>",bombs as aphrodisiacs,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEY3DNS57JTMNPNXKDE6Y6DA6DEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I picked up his masterpiece, The Devil in the White City, at the requisite time in college to be enjoyed. (I was still enthralled with serial killers and just beginning to appreciate higher-level history books.) The Devil in the White City immediately became one of my favorite books. So, of course, his thoroughly-acclaimed In the Garden of Beasts was next. If The Devil in the White City can be simplified to a dual narrative of prolific murderer H.H. Holmes and the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, In The Garden of Beasts could likewise be simplified as a dual narrative of Nazi Germany and the U.S. Ambassador to Germany’s family. While I much preferred Devil to Beasts, both were good enough for me to A) put all of Erik Larson’s books on my list. Now he publishes a new historical narrative that will envelop the hearts and minds of many.<br><br>If my theory (every Larson book encompasses two interwoven narratives) is correct, then in The Splendid and the Vile it is undeniably Churchill’s family on the one hand and Churchill’s job of defending Britain (and, by extension, the world) from Nazi Germany on the other. The Splendid and the Vile leans heavily on the world-historical angle, in this case, as he frames the story around the series of German Luftwaffe air raids known today as the Battle of Britain or, more colloquially, the Blitz. This choice is partially because everything happening with Churchill’s family must happen in the context of the ongoing bombings, but I believe it is just as much a conscious choice because of the depth at which one can delve into the psychology of British society during the Blitz.<br><br>Larson hits on what is, to me, the most interesting part of the Blitz when he writes:<br>The censors claimed to have detected a paradox, that “morale is highest in places that have been most badly bombed.”<br><br>Malcolm Gladwell writes about this paradox in David &amp; Goliath (only an ok book by his standards) and, if I may paraphrase, says that a “near miss” is the quickest way to think of oneself as invincible and thus contributes to morale. Some so many people experienced “near misses”, the thinking goes, that it had a positive effect on morale. There is surely some truth to this, but the same effect was not seen (as far as I know) in Berlin, where the Brits were conducting exhaustive bombing runs of their own, so to my mind, there must be more.<br>Larson also writes of a time when Britain, already rationing its people on almost everything else imaginable, controversially begins to ration its tea. On the heels of my review of 1774: The Long Year of Revolution, I had to laugh at the overwhelming importance those darn Brits place on their leafy beverages. But I also found it immensely interesting how, as Larson explains, the British people needed a sense of normalcy in a world of upheaval. Tea, he argues, became synonymous with carrying on, and the small routines could be considered an act of defiance against the onslaught of bombers. Compare that with Goebbels’ declaration that “(a) sloppy Christmas tree atmosphere lasting several weeks is out of tune with the militant mood of the German people” and the contrast between Britain and Germany could not be more clear.<br><br>There are so many reasons to read The Splendid and the Vile. If you want examples of what total war is like during WWII, there is no better passage than the following, during one of the raids:<br>Over the next six hours, 505 bombers carrying 7,000 incendiaries and 718 tons of high-explosive bombs of all sizes swarmed the sky over London. Thousands of bombs fell and ripped into all corners of the city, but they did especially grave damage in Whitehall and Westminster. Bombs hit Westminster Abbey, the Tower of London, the Law Courts. One bomb sliced through the tower that housed Big Ben. To everyone’s relief, the clock’s immense bell boomed just minutes afterward, at two A.M. Fire consumed a large portion of the famous roof of Westminster Hall, built in the eleventh century by King William Rufus (William II). In Bloomsbury, flames raced through the British Museum, destroying an estimated 250,000 books and devouring the Roman Britain Room, the Greek Bronze Room, and the Prehistoric Room. Happily, as a precaution, the exhibits in these rooms had been removed for safekeeping. A bomb struck the Peek Frean cookie factory (which now also made tank parts). Two parachute mines blew up a cemetery, scattering old bones and fragments of monuments over the landscape and launching a coffin lid into the bedroom of a nearby house. The irate homeowner, in bed with his wife at the time, carried the lid out of the house and brought it to a group of rescue workers. “I was in bed with my missus when this bloody thing came through the window,” he said. “What do I do with it?”<br><br>Add to all of these mindblowing facts another paradox of the Blitz:<br>The odds that any one person would die on any one night were slim, but the odds that someone, somewhere in London would die were 100 percent. Safety was a product of luck alone.<br><br>The juxtaposition of the joy and horror of the Blitz makes Larson’s book unique.<br><br>One can just begin to understand why there was so much optimism and yet so much grief, even death, at once. What such a thing does to the psychology of the nation I cannot grasp, but you get little glimpses of an answer through Larson’s narrative. It is this tension that fuels the whole book and makes it worth reading, even if you already think you know plenty about the period. I would argue that the push and pull of joy and sorrow is the whole point of the book. How do I know? It’s right there in the title. Here is the titular explainer, taken from the diary of John Colville, a civil servant in Churchill’s administration:<br>It was magnificent and terrible: the spasmodic drone of enemy aircraft overhead; the thunder of gunfire, sometimes close sometimes in the distance; the illumination, like that of electric trains in peace-time, as the guns fired; and the myriad stars, real and artificial, in the firmament. Never was there such a contrast of natural splendor and human vileness.<br><br>It’s beautiful, and it’s woven throughout the book. The dual nature of human existence is seen in Larson’s dual narrative, and I can’t help but think it’s deliberate that the reader learns the meaning of the title very close to the exact middle of the book. This is why I will always read Erik Larson: his writing begs to be consumed slowly and purposefully<br>.<br>I received an eARC of The Splendid and the Vile courtesy of Crown Publishing and NetGalley, but my opinions are my own.</span>",The Churchills and the Blitz,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AESYEZ3EN7NAETR42GOL3GHFCHEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It begins when Churchill takes the mantle of Prime Minister and shoulders the burden of England’s war effort. As the year progresses, Larson traces the lives of Churchill’s family, closest advisors, and assistants while also keeping an eye on the actions of Goebbels, Goring, and Hitler. A primary focus is the bombing program against London. Larson keeps an eye on the logistics of Churchill’s life as well as those of the British war effort. He also invests a lot of attention toward the personal and social lives of these key players and makes extensive use of personal journals to keep the focus on the human impact of the war.<br><br>The book helped to explain the development of technologies, ideas, and various conflicts. One thread that I found particularly helpful to trace was America’s involvement in offering aid to Great Britain. While week by week hundreds of civilians are being bombarded and dying, American aloofness must have been agonizing to Churchill and the British populace. Also agonizing must have been the wait for the Lend Lease Act to be passed. This act, which I had only known in name prior to my reading, allowed America to leverage its resources with repayment assured only for damaged property. Larson used the analogy of lending a neighbor a hose when his house is on fire. You don’t sit down and negotiate the terms and cost of hose usage, you give him the hose. Then, if it is burned up in the firefight, you can talk remuneration after the fire has been doused. So too would the Lend Lease Act make some of America’s resources available to our British allies.<br><br>In reading the book, aside from specific actions on specific days, I didn’t learn much new information about Churchill. A great orator, indefatigable, an embracer of life, a drinker, a man with a temper, stalwart, a bit of an eccentric. Some interesting tidbits were sprinkled throughout such as his proclivity for working from the bathtub and the bed, but no deeper, heretofore unknown depths of character were uncovered.<br><br>Having read two other books by Larson, Devil in the White City and Thunderstruck, I was glad to find a better organized story in this book. Chronology was clear and themes developed slowly but organically. Overall, I am left with a clearer understanding of Churchill as a man and military leader and a greater appreciation for the human impact of war. In the midst of truly prodigious bombing, the citizens of Great Britain carried on with their lives, withstood, endured. It seemed that every person, in one way or another, paid a terrible price and yet the result was triumph in the face of evil.<br><br>GRADE: B+</span>",A Man in the Midst of War,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDBWAKQKYGDUAVWTAXAE5AINLFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

As I hope most readers already know, Churchill took office at a  moment of extreme challenge for the British Empire, when  Nazi Germany had conquered most of Europe.  Over the next year Churchill guided his nation through  innumerable perils, as bombs flattened cities and killed thousands while a badly outnumbered but valiant air force fought back against a seemingly all powerful foe.<br><br>This is a tale which has been told many times before, but it always bears recounting, especially at the hands of such a masterly story teller as Erik Larson, who is well known for creating works of history that read like the most sensational fiction.  Here Larson portrays Churchill not only as the indomitable war leader but also as a harried husband and father, dealing with a wayward son and daughter in law, a teenage daughter, a loving but mercurial wife, and a lifetime habit of lavish spending that his income could not support.  Churchill the crafty diplomat and Machiavellian is also well depicted, especially in Larson's recountings of the Prime Minister's efforts to convince the US President (another Machiavellian) to bring his country into the war.  We also get personal views of what life was like during the Blitz and the Battle of Britain from the memoirs and other accounts of countless numbers of ordinary Londoners, along with asides from the German leadership's own point of view.<br><br>Larson's research is thorough, making use of archives in the US and Europe as well as many published accounts. His writing is vivid and colorful, with a keen eye for anecdotes like those recounting the amount of work Churchill did while soaking in bathtubs or when, shortly after Pearl Harbor during a visit to the White House, he had a lengthy conversation with FDR while nude.  If after reading The Splendid and the Vile you would like to learn more about Churchill, Roosevelt, and the period,I can do no better than to recommend Doris Kearns Goodwin's No Ordinary Time and Lynne Olson's Citizens of London, Last Hope Island, and Those Angry Days.</span>",A Personal Account,

The author makes a few mistakes: (1)  he tends to go too deep into specific archaic elements of the story, (2) he does not do a good job explaining the context of the blitz, and (3) he doesn't develop any characters well including Churchill.<br><br>The first in my mind is the biggest issue. Diving into his study, the author goes into sometimes excruciating detail to explain mind-numbing facts about different characters during the time, the frustration of the Germans, the reluctance of the Americans. In addition, he spends a lot of time repeating himself which leaves me as a reader frustrated and bored.<br><br>The second is, the author is completely laser focused on 1940 and 1941, and in addition just the Blitz without getting into much detail on the context of the war. Ultimately the book lacks the breadth and sense of drama that would make it interesting, going too deep on depth.<br><br>Finally, and most tragically, the author does not do a good job explaining any of the characters well, including Churchill. He often focuses on the ""What"" and the ""How"" when it comes to any character actions instead of the ""Why"". This makes the book very tedious indeed.</span>","Tedious, very slow moving and hard to follow",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AECZS2NMV66SVWAJC6LZ2GXN4XQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

With well-sourced quotations throughout the book one clearly sees Churchill’s courage, inspirational leadership, his oratory skills and his keen ability to recruit talented individuals and upset the status quo of the entrenched bureaucracy. Besides required gruesome descriptions of the bombing and carnage, the book has fascinating details including things like: how Hess, the third highest Nazi, escaped to Scotland, how the censors operated and the inability of the UK intelligence service to estimate the size of the German Luftwaffe; moreover, the inability of the Brits could to  estimate the number of RAF planes in operational condition at any given time even while massively increasing aircraft production vital to the War effort. Incidental to Churchill’s success was his ability to deal with his drinking, his own quirky behaviors and a soap opera of salacious behaviors going on as a back story to winning the war in Europe.  This book is highly recommended as a different insight to Churchill and his role in winning WWII.</span>",Excellent and entertaining way to review the lessons of how the Allies began to win World War II,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDTVETH2WHCQTZ2ZKK6UT477EUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Churchill, WW2, and various members of the German high command were covered in Mr Larson's normal superb writing style and interwoven as he does so consummately. But ultimately there was very little new to be said or revealed-it's all been done before, many times.<br>As an entertaining and concise history of all the characters, their connections and involvement in WW2 it was first class, but no great climax or finale, because we all know what happened.<br>His previous books have combined high profile events with interwoven personal stories, many of which have not been written about before (ie mass murderers and the Chicago World Fair), here was material which has been so well and frequently documented that nothing new of any real consequence was revealed.<br>I suppose I should say that for those who know little about Winston Churchill, his involvement with WW2 and some the role of his German protagonists, this would be a great primer.<br>Sorry Mr Larson, but this one was something of a disappointment.</span>",Not what I expected from this author.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFANRIMUTD2SPYXOF2L37CJIOGIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The author also spends a considerable amount of time exploring the abrasive, obnoxious, and strangely effective wartime stewardship of Lord Beaverbrook (formerly a mere newspaper magnate) over the production of fighter planes.<br><br>Highly recommended!  This book takes you back to a time of real crisis when a nation stood alone against the might of Nazi Germany without any certainty that the United States would enter the war.  Churchill's leadership was surely the difference between those who wished to succumb to Germany's continental victories and enter into a peace with Hitler (at great cost, no doubt), and those who desired to fight on against the might of Nazi Germany (also at great cost).  As Churchill opined at the time to his advisors, nations which go down fighting rise again; those that surrender, are finished.  Churchill won the day; the Germans never did invade England; and because Great Britain held on in 1940 and 1941, the invasion of France and the eventual defeat of Hitler's Germany later became possible after America entered the war, using England as a forward logistics and bombing base.<br><br>My only criticism of the book is that the author did not focus upon the Argentia Conference off Newfoundland, where FDR and Churchill met secretly at sea in August of 1941; but that subject has been covered in many other books.</span>",One of the Better Churchill Books,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEEBN7ABCGS6DBMMJBK24QX72TJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Same as with another book of him that i read (the Devil in the White City), he shows his talent of taking real stories and transforming them into vivid, page-turning thrillers. This book portraits the first year of Churchil's as Britain's prime minister, which surely was the most challenging and depressing year any British prime Minister has ever experience. Through the details of the day to day life in Britain those days and details of Churchil and the British government's work during this time, the author was successful in reflecting the real life at one hand and the critical occurrences and decisions of these days on the other hand. It shows Chuchil at its greatest moments as the nation leader while presenting his human, not always perfect, features and characteristics. Only after reading this book one could really understand the gravity of Britain's situation in this eventful days and one could not underestimate Churchil's courage and genius in leading the nation and crafting the faithful decisions and policies that saved Britain and led to the defeat of the Natzi monster.</span>",Great tale of exceptional person at exceptional times,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDZCJFS4EPDW4XJED4PYTQKAVTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Less than a year into World War II, Britain was on the brink of defeat:<br><br>** The British public, its military leaders, and Churchill himself lived in fear, day after day, of an imminent Nazi invasion.<br><br>** France was barely more than a month away from surrendering to the Nazis.<br><br>** German U-boats were sinking merchant ships far faster than the country could replace them, threatening the people of the British isles with starvation.<br><br>** On the Continent, the British Expeditionary Force was encircled by German forces, retreating toward the French coast and facing almost certain annihilation.<br><br>Was an aging alcoholic up to the job?<br><br>Yet somehow the aging Prime Minister—an alcoholic with a reputation for questionable judgment—mobilized the British people despite what so many were convinced was a hopeless fight against the Nazi juggernaut. Both King George VI and some of Churchill’s colleagues in the Cabinet were skeptical that he was up to the job. Regardless, through sheer force of will and an unparalleled gift for stirring rhetoric, Churchill led his nation virtually alone in the world for eighteen months before the United States finally entered the war.<br><br>Churchill’s lofty rhetoric is familiar to anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the Second World War. His speeches are often quoted to this day on both sides of the Atlantic. In The Splendid and the Vile, Larson reveals what is often missing from accounts of those addresses.<br><br>The backstory for Churchill’s legendary speeches<br><br>For example, many are familiar with his ringing speech to Parliament promising to “fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender—” But Larson adds, “As the House roared its approval, Churchill muttered to a colleague, ‘And . . . we will fight them with the butt end of broken bottles, because that’s bloody well all we’ve got.” Larson also reports that this speech, which Churchill read on BBC Radio that evening, received little attention from the public. Many who listened thought he sounded drunk. In fact, Larson reveals, he read the speech with a cigar in his mouth.<br><br>The result was problematic. “Home Intelligence reported that only two newspapers ‘gave Churchill’s speech headline value’ and that the speech had done little to fortify the public.” But the author implies that this lack of attention was of little consequence to the Prime Minister because “the audience Churchill had mainly in mind when he crafted his speech was, once again, America.” It’s details like this that make Larson’s account so hard to forget.<br><br>How did the man manage day to day in the midst of the Blitz?<br><br>The story of Churchill’s courage and his brilliant if unorthodox leadership style is well known. What is less well known is how he managed from day to day to persist in the face of such overwhelming odds during that critical first year of his five years in office. And that’s the story Erik Larson tells, and tells so well, in The Splendid and the Vile.<br><br>Historians typically zero in on the stuff of politics and policy, and in wartime on the ebb and flow of battle. Not so Erik Larson, one of the most outstanding popular historians writing today in the English language. While all that is present in The Splendid and the Vile, Larson’s focus is on the emotional reality of life in and around 10 Downing Street during that fateful year. He vividly conveys a sense of what it would have been like to be Winston Churchill or a member of his inner circle or his family. As he writes in the book’s acknowledgments, “I set out to hunt for the stories that often get left out of the massive biographies of Churchill, either because there’s no time to tell them or because they seem frivolous. But it is in frivolity that Churchill often revealed himself.”<br><br>Private diaries cast light on Winston Churchill in WWII<br><br>Larson draws largely on diaries written by his private secretaries and his then eighteen-year-old daughter Mary. He also leans heavily on contemporaneous accounts from an official research effort called Home Intelligence and a privately organized research program called Mass-Observation. Both of the latter employed hundreds of individuals throughout society to record their observations in diaries on a daily basis. Larson offers us an intimate look at the lives they all lived while thousands of tons of German bombs rained down all around them, day after day after day, and Churchill helped set the world’s future course. And he leavens his tale with accounts of the German perspective, delving deeply into the diary of a Nazi air ace, records of Rudolf Hess‘s quixotic flight to Scotland, and reports of the clumsy antics of the Luftwaffe’s Hermann Göring. It’s a remarkable accomplishment.<br><br>“From the very start,” Larson notes, “Churchill understood a fundamental truth about the war: that he could not win it without the eventual participation of the United States.” Deservedly, then, Larson devotes special attention to Churchill’s relentless campaign to persuade President Franklin Roosevelt to resist the isolationists who hobbled him politically and come to the defense of embattled Britain. This story is well known, but Larson tells it with a light touch, revealing intimate details of the two men’s growing relationship that are often missing from scholarly accounts of the war.<br>A focus on Churchill’s family and his inner circle<br><br>Larson draws our attention squarely to the Prime Minister’s inner circle. These were not primarily the exalted figures who populated the War Cabinet such as Viscount Halifax, Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, and Neville Chamberlain (at the outset), but the men who interacted with him on a daily basis and often lived with him at Chequers and Ditchley on the weekends. These were Churchill’s friends—the men in whom he confided:<br><br>** Press lord Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook, an intimate friend whom he pressed into service as Minister of Aircraft Production. It was Beaverbrook who bullied nearly everyone around him regardless of rank to circumvent the many bureaucratic hurdles that had kept aircraft production low. And he was wildly successful, “doubling fighter output within his first three months” on the job.<br><br>** General Hastings (Pug) Ismay, his chief military advisor. As Private Secretary Jock Colville noted in his diary, “Churchill owed more, and admitted that he owed more” to him for his aid and support “than to anybody else, military or civilian, in the whole of the war.”<br><br>** Frederick (The Prof) Lindemann, Churchill’s personal scientific advisor. The Prof was an eccentric who obsessed about clever but often unworkable ideas that seem to have captivated Churchill. In fact, the Prime Minister’s fascination with gadgets is well known and has been the subject of books, film, and television production.<br><br>His wife, Clementine Churchill, played an advisory role from to time but her suggestions were less likely to be heeded. And the Prime Minister happily spent hour after hour with the two men Franklin Roosevelt sent on special missions to confer with him: first, Harry Hopkins, and later Averell Harriman. Both became, for a time, fully fledged members of the inner circle as well.<br><br>Many others had front-row seats on the Prime Minister’s day-to-day life<br><br>Others, no doubt, considered themselves intimate with Churchill, but if Larson’s account may be believed, Beaverbrook, Ismay, and the Prof were the stalwart and indispensable men to whom Churchill most often turned for support during that first year of his time at 10 Downing Street.<br><br>Others with front-row seats convey how these men all interacted, principally private secretary John (Jock) Colville. But Larson’s account is enriched by the passages in Colville’s diary that reflect on his unrequited love for a young woman and on daughter Mary Churchill girlish preoccupations during the early months of the war. And the story of Churchill’s unhappily married daughter-in-law, Pamela Churchill, adds a fascinating dimension to the tale. (First wed to Randolph, Churchill’s spendthrift and philandering son, Pamela later married Hollywood and Broadway producer Leland Hayward, and, finally, in 1979, Averell Harriman, with whom she had had an affair in the course of the events related in The Splendid and the Vile.<br><br>The title of this stirring book comes not from Shakespeare or one of the ancients, as we might surmise, but from a passage in one of Jock Colville’s diaries: “Never was there such a contrast of natural splendor and human vileness.”</span>","An intimate view of Churchill during the Blitz, and Larson's best",

Rightfully so I suspect because after all it was American History. But then again, World History classes didn't discuss the subject either. Erick Larson however with his very detailed style of writing, did a masterful job of describing the dire consequences England was facing during this period. Winston Churchill had just become Prime Minister and his army was fleeing for their lives at Dunkirk. The only good news was, not as many British Soldiers were killed in this evacuation as predicted. If one may call that good news. Mr. Larson really has the reader feeling how alone England really was in their efforts of defending democracy from the German Empire. Germany's Blitzkrieg rolled over Europeans with great ease and the soon realized vulnerable French,  were now the only defense between them and the German army. The French had prepared for the invasion by building a massive line of impenetrable connected bunkers. Who knew the German army would just go around them. Shortly, the French  negotiated a surrender with Germany and now there was no protection from being invaded. For the 1st year of Churchill's administration each and every day the British people were unnerved at the prospect of be invaded. The only thought Hitler and his staff didn't consider was resistance. Hitler mistakenly took the entire British Empire as nothing to be concerned about and with his advisors were convinced they could take England with their air bombardment followed up by a ground invasion. What i learned from this book is more about the resolve of the British people. For many days, several in a row, the clouds over England at night were full of bombers applying massive destruction to a historic empire. And yet, people went out to dinner, attended movies, plays and actually danced many nights away at local and regional night clubs. I'm sure there were people that stayed in bunkers, basements or what have you, but for the most part, people seem to treat the bombs as an inconvenience as they went about their work days. I really enjoyed the description by Mr. Larsen of  Joseph Goebbels, one of the most powerful leaders of the Nazi party, as he painted his fingernails and dressed up in lavish outfits to attend public parties. There seems to be no denying that Churchill had is idiosyncrasies as well. Mr. Larson described how he enjoyed putting on his uni suit and marching around in front of his  dinner guests to military marching tunes until way into the early hours of the following day. There were at times I thought perhaps too much ink was spent on Mary Churchill but then again, it sets the tone for what all British citizens were up to as well. I have read all of Erick Larson's books and as soon as I saw this one offered for a pre purchase via Amazon I clicked the order button with out even reading the bibliography. It's not my favorite Larson book, but by far not my least favorite.

The first year of Churchill’s leadership was a crucial time for a number of reasons.  Increasing production of airplanes and war material was certainly critical, but even more important was keeping morale high.  Larson repeatedly emphasizes that it was Churchill’s oratorial skills that bolstered the nation. “…Churchill demonstrated a striking trait: his knack for making people feel loftier, stronger, and, above all, more courageous.”  Again: “Churchill’s great trick… was his ability to deliver dire news and yet leave his audience feeling encouraged and uplifted.”<br><br>Not only is this a detailed look at Churchill’s first year in office, it’s about the people closest to him.  His inner circle included family, staff, and various war ministers, and each played a vital role in supporting the formidable PM.  I learned quite a bit about how desperately England relied on America’s aide and how the Lend-Lease Act was paramount to England not capitulating to the Nazi onslaught.  I was also previously unaware that the British navy actually fired on French ships so they wouldn’t end up in German possession after the fall of France.<br><br>As always, Larson delivers a compelling story in an approachable, engaging narrative.  The Blitz came alive on the pages and I could feel the desperation and the hope of the civilians who endured the long nights of air raids. As one observer noted, seeing Churchill console bombed Londoners: “…it typified the uniquely unpredictable magic that was Churchill – his ability to transform ‘the despondent misery of disaster into a grimly certain stepping stone to ultimate victory.’”</span>",Excellent!,

In Erik Larson's latest history, the reader learns in-depth about the first year of Churchill's role as Prime Minister, May 1940-May 1941.  The new PM displayed unbridled optimism and boundless energy.  His ""Secret Circle"" included men of industry, science and politics.  Despite 57 nights of consecutive bombing by the Luftwaffe, Churchill's oratory and his presence, often in tears,  amidst the rubble of  London, forcibly demonstrated his grit, sympathy and empathy. Churchill and Britain would fight on!  He knew he could not win without the help of the USA.  Larson deftly unfolds the diplomatic game of ""cat and mouse"" between Churchill and FDR until the agreement for Lend Lease was finalized.<br><br>Larson's compelling prose puts the reader in the chambers of Parliamentary debate, in the cockpits of both Messerschmitts and Spitfires, in the London tube during the blitz,  in the night fire-bombing of Coventry and at the county estate of Chequers where Churchill ""recharged his batteries"" and convened with trusted advisors.  Here too, the reader glimpses the drama in the lives of the Churchill family including his supportive wife, Clementine, the coming-of-age daughter, Mary and the unraveling of his son Randolph and duaghter-in-law Pamela Digby.  Larson keeps the drama high domestically, nationally and internationally.  As always with this author, it is history presented at its best!</span>","""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.""",

His works are the result of exhaustive research and his talent at bringing authenticity and life to history. This is a unique book, especially since, as Larson freely admits, there are thousands and thousands of pages written about WW II, Churchill, and every single day of the war. Yet Larson has found original material in Mary Churchill's diary, and integrates it brilliantly in the diaries of Churchill's assistants, Goebbels, and the British observers who wrote about the morale of the country in real time.  It's Mary Churchill who really stands out. She tried to be a young girl enjoying life in the midst of hell. Her sweetness and innocence stand out in a time of death, vileness, and horror. Hitler wanted England to quietly surrender but when that didn't happen, and indeed, Churchill and the RAF had the temerity to bomb German cities in 1940 and 1941, the gloves came off and Hermann Goring filled the sky with bombers. He delivered relentless and unopposed waves of air attacks, especially during nights when the moon was full. The targets were allegedly military centers, as at Coventry, but then all of London was being bombed, with thousands dead. Larson makes these days of suffering,  courage, and even humor come alive! Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know what a true leader is all about.</span>","""I have nothing to hide.""

The narrative is at once epic and intimate in scope.  And it so poignantly speaks to our dire present.  If it hadn't been for Churchill's unique genius for both telling brutal truths and inspiring/energizing, England would almost certainly have capitulated to Nazi Germany following Poland's fall in 1939.

Have read all his works and they reside as treasures in my library. When reading “A Note to Readers” about moving to NYC caused the question of “Why” but fortunately the experience resulted in this magnificent book. The comment of “how did the Churchill’s and their circle cope?” can be expanded to the entire British people of the time!  As mentioned Churchill caused the WWII British to recognize and employ their own courage when facing alone the might of the NAZI military and its extremist and inhuman ideology. While Churchill felt relief with Imperial Japan’s attack on U.S. Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941 Hitler did not declare war on the U.S. until 11 December 1941. An historic “What if ?” is what would have been the consequences if Hitler had not declared war on the U.S.?  What influence would the America First Committee (AFC) and its NAZI sympathizers play in thwarting President Franklin Roosevelt’s efforts to engage Hitler’s Germany?  What is also particularly concerning that reading of this period of the NAZI regime in Berlin one hears echoes of the present.</span>,Outstanding!,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEDEHHBU3BMTWVNUIS2O57OXSQQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The book closely follows his process of brilliantly creating non-fiction books into thrilling, character driven page turners.  I have read many books on Churchill, and many, many more on the Battle of Britain and the Blitz.  This ranks up there as a new favorite.  While making it very clear that Churchill was a deeply flawed man, the book is clearly also a love letter to our amazing Winnie.  Brilliant, reactive, warm, cold, funny, infuriating Winnie.  The book also focused on wartime production, the home front, the Churchill family and the inner circle.  There's a whole lot happening, but it all weaves together into an excellent read.  Typical Larson.  And I mean that in the best possible way.  I love his formula, and I love that he knows his fans love it.  I always liken reading his books to watching Ken Burns documentaries.

I did not realize it was a very specific time in Winston Churchill's life and not the entire war. It was interesting to read how regular life went on during heavy attack and bombing, but 1/2 way thru the book I found myself wanting to speed thru to the later part of the war and see how Churchill defeated the enemy and what his inner circle was thinking then.  But as it was just the few years of heavy attach and strife the victorious ending of the war was glossed over in summary.

The interjections of some of the family member's love life wasn't very interesting and didn't more the story forward much even while giving a glimpse into their lives as war swirled around them. We all know how it ended and the steps to victory. Access to diaries and the research involved on the part of Larson is impressive, however.

This is a story about real people who look like extraordinary characters of a fiction book telling us a surreal story. A real inspiring story that any people loving of freedom should know.</span>",CHURCHILL BEST YEAR,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLZMS34KORBGTTVB2HA3YIEJ7OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

After France surrenderedl shockingly quickly to the Nazis, the burden of stopping Germany's onslaught fell on Britain. America's isolationism and Roosevelt's reluctance to rock the cart in an election year made Britain's situation very difficult. This book highlights the incredible courage and determination of the nation and its prime minister while waiting for the US to officially join the war effort. Britain had not been invaded since the 1066 Norman conquest and Churchill was not going to let it happen on his watch.  Fans of WWII history will especially appreciate the  ""behind the scenes"" look at Churchill and his circle.</span>",The Battle For Britain,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVPCF64UY64WWVZR6IUSE3IBHIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Mr. Larson sifts through an ocean of documented history and produced one of the most intimate portraits of Winston Churchill I have ever read.  What made the books so compelling to me was the opinions of those in  Churchill's inner circle.  Opinions written in diaries they were not suppose to have kept (as a matter or national security.)  These are not musings after the fact but real time opinions while the bombs were still falling.

I have recommended this book to my husband who enjoys World War II history, even though I have not yet finished the book.

This book, however provides a refreshing look at a giant of the 20th Century. Churchill's extended family is examined in some detail. That he had to deal with ""problem children"" while trying to hold Great Britain a free nation was quite an ordeal.

Plus these references are placed in potions of chapters which chapters have nothing to do with those characters. Perhaps the author just wished to build his rereference material.

Mr. Larson has the talent through his style of writing to strip layer after layer of his major characters so that the reader develops a personalized relationship with each one. As a result, a sense of familiarity is created between the reader and character. The reader is transcended into the scene where one is not an onlooker but is directly connected to that scene be it in a war room, a dinner party or in a Nazi bomber plane. This formula makes for a wonderful reading experience.<br><br>Mr. Larson's writing style leaves me with a ""what is going to happen next"" moment. His ability to weave his central theme in a good guy/bad guy interplay makes his books riveting to read. Such is the style found in THE SPLENDID AND THE VILE.<br><br>In reading this book, I have developed a new found respect for Winston Churchill. His courage that he displayed through the endless Nazi bombing raids on English cities is remarkable. His encouragement to those around him and to the English people to carry on, his perseverance, his exuberance, his love for his country are all factors to England's survival during WW II. He carried the United Kingdom forward through its darkest hour.<br><br>Winston Churchill represented a true statesman so sorely missed on today's international stage of diplomacy.<br><br>In 1968 Americans were singing, ""Where are you Joe DiMaggio, your nation turns its lonely eyes on you.""

This did not disappoint, I believe it’s his best next to Dead Wake. Erik Larson presents history as if it were a novel. Lots of information, the facts are presented in a way that’s far from bland.

Larson artfully mines the diaries of Churchill's family members and associates to create a day to day portrait of life under the capricious risk of German bombs. The adolescent hopes of Churchill's young daughter segue to the desolation of Coventry or Plymouth after a Luftwaffe attack.

After Neville Chamberlain failed in his attempt to make peace with Hitler, sixty-five-year-old Winston Churchill became England's prime minister. Churchill surrounded himself with trusted advisors and employed his impressive oratorical skills to keep his countrymen from losing heart. Initially, in spite of Churchill's pleas, President Franklin Roosevelt refused to offer much-needed military and economic aid to Great Britain. Roosevelt knew all too well how reluctant most Americans were to become involved in another bloody conflict.<br><br>The author conveys the chaos of this turbulent year, provides glimpses into the personal lives of those in Churchill's orbit, and offers insight into the strategy of the German high command.  Larson is a meticulous researcher whose primary sources include diaries, letters, and memoirs.  We learn the extent to which Clementine Churchill, Winston's wife, staunchly supported her husband. She was politically astute, tough under pressure, and compassionate towards her fellow citizens. Unfortunately, Churchill's long hours, irascibility, and mood swings took a significant toll on his family. Randolph, the Churchills' rebellious son, grew up to become an alcoholic, compulsive gambler, and a ladies' man (even after he was married and had a child of his own).<br><br>""The Splendid and the Vile"" reinforces what many of us already know about Churchill's eccentricities, bursts of energy, and bouts of depression. Humorous and lively anecdotes enliven the narrative but, as it progresses, it becomes repetitious, and could have been pared down with no loss of impact.  There is too much information about the parties attended by Churchill's youngest daughter, Mary; the weekends that the Churchills spent eating lavish meals and entertaining guests; the romantic longings and liaisons of various characters; and the infighting between self-important government officials.<br><br>However, it is impossible to be unmoved by the commitment, spirit, and dedication of Churchill, the airmen of the RAF, and the many other heroes who sacrificed so much to defeat a cruel and relentless enemy.  Larson brilliantly demonstrates that, under challenging circumstances, Churchill and his ministers skillfully managed complex operations and shook up hidebound bureaucracies. Moreover the prime minister's eloquent radio addresses galvanized his listeners and helped them endure what must have felt like an endless series of ferocious onslaughts. As Larson states in his introduction, ""It is one thing to say, 'Carry on,' quite another to do it.""</span>","""Only he had the power to make the nation believe that it could win.""",

It’s interesting to see the how the young friends of Pamela proceed with their privileged lives of parties and luxurious while the country is at war.

In The Splendid and the Vile his meticulous research and talented writing give readers a fascinating look into one year in the life of Winston Churchill. Starting in May of 1941, just before he takes office as Prime Minister, Larson details the conversations, the meetings, and the speeches, but also the eccentricities of the leader and interworking of his whole family. This year holds the surrender of the French, the beginning of The Blitz, and calls to isolationist America for help.<br><br>Even though the book is weighty at just over 600 pages, the chapters are on the smaller size and are balanced well between the British side of the war and other points of view.  The descriptions of the places are excellent and drew me in immediately to each scene. Another thing is Larson’s use of diary entries. Some are derived from the public who took part in a government project to get firsthand knowledge of the war.<br><br>Personal Note: I have like now read all of Larson’s books, and while I love his writing style, I just liked the subjects of a couple of his pieces a better than others. The Devil and the While City and Thunderstruck were excellent books that contained little-known true crime mysteries. And his last three books (Dead Wake, In the Garden of Beasts, and The Splendid and the Vile) have been without much mystery and their topics have covered parts of history that one can readily find. His writing is always good and he certainly picks out smaller characters to highlight in the overall scenes of history, but I just liked the other books for their singular subjects.<br><br>The Splendid and the Vile is an excellent piece of history. Perfect for that WW2 buff who is looking to expand their knowledge of one of the great leaders of the war.</span>",The Splendid and the Vile is an excellent piece of history.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG5H6IDZPBUWVTQ252TYAZ2EPETQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Thanks go to Net Galley and Crown Publishing for the review copy. This book is for sale today.<br><br>I have spent most of my life dodging stories of the second world war, largely because I had grown bored, as a young woman, hearing my father’s ramblings with friends. No young person wants to hear their parent’s stories unless they involve great fame or heroism, and perhaps not always, even then. And so, when someone older than myself would speak of “the war,” my ears closed at once. Footage of Churchill’s iconic speeches sometimes popped up on the television, but all I heard was “blah blah blah,” and I would either change the channel or leave the room. And so, it is only now—after a career of teaching American history and government to teenagers—that I find myself curious about Churchill.<br><br>The book begins when King George asks Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain—who, along with his staff, had been carrying on with ordinary length work days despite the crisis at hand, and who had been contemplating a surrender to Germany—to step down, and then invites Churchill to take his place. Churchill has no intention of surrendering a single centimeter of British soil to Hitler, and soon everyone knows this. The book ends when the United States formally enters the war. By focusing on this brief period, Larson is able to include detail, the meaty anecdotes and quotes that a full length biography would limit. That said, the hard cover version of this book is still over 600 pages in length, if one includes the thorough and excellent end notes, and if you haven’t the stamina for other books of this length, you probably won’t have the stamina for this one, either.<br><br>Since my childhood impression of Churchill was that he was dull and stodgy, I was fascinated to learn how truly unconventional he had been. He often worked 16 hour days and expected his staff to do the same, but he did so on his own terms, breaking for two baths daily (but dictating from the tub to a male secretary that sat tub side, tablet and pencil in hand), and likewise doing business from his bed, not merely over the phone, but with documents, a typist, an immense thermador to hold his two foot long cigars, and his cat, whom he called “darling.” He might be clad in a silk floral dressing gown (in America, this would be a fancy robe) and pom-pom slippers, or he might be buck naked. Today we would refer to the working baths and feet up in bed as a sort of self-care; the fact that he was able to carry it off during much more conventionally straightened times amazes me. He kept a machine gun in the trunk of his car, and he armed his family members, including the women. Invasion was a real possibility, and if it occurred, he and his family would be primary targets. He told them that if they were to be taken, possibly killed, the least they could do would be to take at least one Nazi down with them. And like so many fathers, he climbed onto the roof during Nazi bombing raids to see the action despite the risk, but made his daughter stay far away from London in the countryside lest she find herself in harm’s way.<br><br>Larson incorporates a variety of sources, but the two most frequently quoted are from Colville, who was one of his private secretaries, and Mary Churchill, his teenager. I question the amount of ink young Mary receives initially, but at the end, when I see where life took her, my objections fade. Also included are the views of top Nazi officials, primarily Joseph Goebbels, whose diary shows his dissatisfaction with Roosevelt, whose fireside chats inveighed against Fascism and in favor of the British cousins. Goebbels wishes that Hitler would take a hard line against the Americans, reflecting without an ounce of irony that “One must defend oneself sometime, after all.”<br><br>Larson’s congenial narrative draws me in almost like narrative nonfiction. Despite the death, the destruction, and the horror, it is—for me, at least—a curiously soothing read in all but one or two of the harshest spots. Perhaps it is because it was long ago and far away, and I know that—this time, at least—the Fascists will lose.<br><br>There is only one photograph in my digital review copy, and a note of a map that will be included in the finished version; I wish there were more. I came to my desktop to see images of the infamous Lord Beaverbrook, the Prof, and Pug Ismay, all of whom were Churchill’s key advisers, and I went to YouTube to listen to the Dunkirk speech and others that were so captivating and celebrated. Now that I grasped the context in which they were given, I can understand why they had an electrifying effect upon the British public and won the favor of other English-speaking nations, my own among them.<br><br>Is this the best Churchill biography? For those that want all the nitty-gritty, there are many others, and Larson refers to them in his introduction, including one that is eight volumes long. For me, though, this is enough. Those that want an approachable yet professional introduction to this subject could do a lot worse; I recommend you get it and read it, and then you can decide if you want to pursue the subject further.<br><br>Highly recommended.</span>",Congenial and Strangely Soothing,

It covers the first year of his leadership, but it was a pivotal year and devastating for the entire nation.  It’s almost incomprehensible to imagine what it was like for Great Britain to endure the relentless and vile bombings they suffered from Nazi Germany.  But Erik Larson has taken what is hard to imagine and helps the reader to learn about this unique and brave leader who inspired a nation and helped Great Britain to endure while suffering great losses and come out victoriously as the great evil of Nazi Germany was defeated.<br><br>When reading this book, God’s providential hand in raising up the right leader for a nation at the right time is evident.  One can only speculate how England would have fared and how WWII would have ended with a different man as Prime Minister.<br><br>Not only do you get to know PM Winston Churchill and his view of the war, but this book really comes to life as you learn about and from the people who surrounded Churchill, what they saw, felt and experienced.  Clementine, Churchill’s wife was every bit his equal and we learn quite a bit about their children, especially their son Randolph and youngest daughter Mary<br><br>Those who surrounded the Prime Minister provide insight into Churchill and how Great Britain prepared and fought the war, including from John Colville, Churchill’s private secretary whose diaries documented behind the scenes happenings, to Frederick Lindermann (The Prof) Churchill’s scientific advisor, to Max Aitken-Lord Beaverbrook the man who Churchill believe would help their country ramp-up aircraft production so they could wage an effective air campaign against the Nazi’s.<br><br>The book also looks at the war through the lens of Nazi leaders including, Hitler, Goring, Goebbels, Hess and flying ace Adolf Galland.  It was both interesting and horrifying to see how they viewed what they were doing and their ultimate goal to defeat Great Britain.<br><br>The Splendid and the Vile is a full-bodied look at Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the people who surrounded him and the people of Great Britain and the suffering they endured.  This is a tremendous book, it’s an interesting, insightful, heartbreaking and thrilling look at history, a strong unique leader and a people who did not crumble when facing great evil unleashed against them.<br><br>I highly recommend The Splendid and the Vile by Erik Larson.  If you read one book this year, this is the one to read.  Especially during this time in our Nation and the world, this book will put into perspective what we are going through compared to what Great Britain and the world endured during WWII.<br><br>I would like to thank Crown Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read The Splendid and the Vile by author Erik Larson.

Mr. Larson is an award winning author and a writer who spent much time on the best sellers’ lists.<br><br>I have enjoyed several of Mr. Larson’s books, and I usually enjoy the type of historical stories which, while accurate, also has an eye towards rumors and how people saw it at the time, without the benefit of hindsight. In The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz by Erik Larson the author tells of the critical year in London which would make or break Winston Churchill as an admired leader and politician.<br><br>At the time Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of England (1940), Hitler was already invading Holland, Belgium, and soon after France.  Hitler became focused on England, offering peace treaties and other promises to them. Churchill, to his credit, wouldn’t trust the Nazis and knew they were lying, trying to arm and build an army which, eventually, the English will not be able to beat.<br><br>As we know, not everyone were happy with the touch stance Mr. Churchill took, and he realized that he needed the support of the US if he wanted to have a chance beating Hitler. The US, headed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, was in isolationist mode and Churchill had to keep up appearances of not needing their help as he so desperately did.<br><br>As a fan of the author, I had high hopes for this book. His talent of for extracting relevant, accurate, entertaining and informative information from the annals of history is something which I envy. Not only does Mr. Larson knows how to research a story, he also knows how to tell it while keeping the reader engaged.<br><br>I feel that this book erred on the side of meticulous research, and somewhere the fascinating story the author was trying to tell got lost. There are details of who’s who, what clothes they were wearing, family relationships and roots, while the blitz takes a second seat to the gossip.<br><br>Just to be clear, I have not problems learning history through gossip and what people said and thought at the time, without hindsight. This time, though, I felt that it bogged down the narrative so much that it made this book a tough read, and not nearly as engaging as the author’s other books.</span>",Meticulous Research,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJ6HRHDMONUH5CE32QV4ECNW5QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Additionally, he adds details from the viewpoints and the lives of Winston’s daughter, Mary, a somewhat starry-eyed eighteen year old, son Randolph, a married but philandering gambler, daughter-in-law Pamela, loving wife Clementine, and private secretary John Colville, among others. All of these people left trails of information behind, whether in diaries, letters, etc., that Larsen used in pursuit of his own approach to Churchill’s life.<br><br>Through this method, combining the very personal daily details with overall war strategy, we readers are allowed a close up view of the intensifying air war over Britain, the Blitz, the Battle of Britain. To counter that, we are also provided with some inkling of what is happening among German leadership.<br><br>I strongly recommend this book to all who enjoy history or just enjoy a true story of a dangerous time very well told.

His portrait of the first year of Winston Churchill's reign as Prime Minister is fascinating, readable history, but so much more; it gives what appears to be a well-rounded picture of Churchill, warts (OK, many of which were endearing if weird) and all; his family members; some of the social atmosphere in which he operated; and more.<br><br>But the treasure of the book is his depiction of how a great leader leads in a time of crisis.  Throughout the unimaginable blitz, Churchill demonstrated candor without pessimism, humor, and a sense of confidence (despite all that was going wrong) so totally unlike what we see in our current leader during a time of pandemic.  Of course, there was also the Churchillian wit,  which has been matched so rarely even in good times -- possibly by JFK, but never since.<br><br>Larson's writing is wonderful -- he knows how to tell a story and infuse it with just the right degree of detail; he's not one of those writers who has to cram everything he's learned into his books.  And even his decision to end the book at the first anniversary of Churchill's ""reign"" as PM -- makes sense, which cannot have been an easy thing to pull off.<br><br>A must for any student of history, leadership, or WWII, but also just a wonderful and enlightening read.</span>",Leadership in a Time of Crisis,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEOBC3QLEFN4JLHNWC7KHXM5JZ5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

This riveting nonfiction account reads like a novel.<br><br>I will always read anything Erik Larsen writes and have done so since I first read Isaac's Storm. The Splendid and the Vile continues Larsen's excellence in nonfiction.<br><br>This is an excellent compelling portrait of Winston Churchill’s first year as British prime minister. From May 1940 to May 1941, the German air force launched an assault against the city of London. The relentless bombing campaign was to terrorize and demoralize the population in preparation for an invasion. It is before the USA was in the war. Churchill had to hold his country together while continually reaching out to President Franklin Roosevelt.<br><br>Larsen profiles Churchill, but also looks at those close to him including, in part: his wife Clementine; their 17-year-old daughter, Mary; their son, Randolph, and his wife, Pamela; his private secretary, John “Jock” Colville; Lord Beaverbrook;  Frederick Lindemann, and others. He also covers the actions of Nazi leaders during this time. Larsen uses diary and journal entries from the people involved, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports, as well as other documents from the time. The people come alive as real humans living through an extraordinary time while under tremendous stress.<br><br>The historical narrative is told through day by day events for the year. It is an eloquent, richly detailed and long account, but the historical facts are written in such a way that it reads like a novel. The history comes alive in this account.

However, few know his private life. Erik Larson has pulled back the curtain and allows us to see the personal side of Churchill. Brilliant statesman, gifted orator, and a man of many quirks. Churchill took over as Prime Minister and was immediately faced with how to calm and encourage a nation facing invasion by Nazi Germany. Using diaries from Churchill's wife, daughter, and friends, Larson is able to provide insight into the changing emotions and challenges faced daily.<br><br>Churchill knew that once Paris fell and France was under Nazi control, it would be necessary to draw the United States into the war. Americans were actively avoiding war. Larson is able to communicate the fine line that Churchill walked as he interfaced with Roosevelt. How do you make the point that you need someone's help urgently and not be pushy?<br><br>One of the most interesting parts of the book is seeing the change in Churchill's daughter from being a selfish, spoiled girl to a woman wanting to aid as much as possible.

Winston Churchill, not always well-liked by his fellow countrymen, is a figure of strength and encouragement at a time when there seemed to be little hope for England.<br><br>This book is obviously well-researched but the information is intertwined into a readable and fascinating tale, with a variety of characters, interesting dialogue, and descriptions that bring the story to life.

This is a very informative and interesting read which was greatly researched even up to last year. I have read many historical novels about England during the war and this just added to their appeal. Churchill was a very complex man with unusual eccentricities, who was fearless and who could bring his country through hard times. The plight of the typical Englishman as well as the upper class was depicted in great detail.

At the same time he deftly places very personal stories in the larger context of time and place. In this book, he tackles the first year of Churchill’s leadership of Britain as prime minister, encompassing the fall of France and the low countries to the Nazis, the evacuation of British troops at Dunkirk, the anticipation of of Nazi invasion on the shores of Britain, and the rain of bombs that fell on London and other metropolitan centers during the Blitz.<br><br>In The Splendid and the Vile, Larson tells the story of life within Churchill’s inner circle, comprising not only his chief advisors during the war, but also those staff and family members who shared his day-to-day life.<br><br>Larson’s task was made easier by the brilliant wartime diary of John “Jock” Colville, from which the author quotes extensively.  Colville came from a well-connected family, graduated from  Cambridge, and joined the diplomatic corps only to be seconded at age 25 first to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and then to Churchill. Colville is a beautiful writer in his own right and many of his personal insights and experiences find their way into Larson’s book.<br><br>The book is also enlivened by a second diary, that of Churchill’s youngest daughter Mary, who was 17 turning 18 in 1940-41. These entries are charming not only as a window into Churchill family life but also into the perspective of a young girl on the cusp of adulthood. Often the war in her perception was overshadowed by teenage crushes and the desire to spread her wings socially. Mary narrowly escaped joining fellow debutantes at a late night club in central London, which received a direct hit from a bomb, killing most inside. But there wasn’t a lot of introspection as recorded in Mary’s diary — life went on, and likely this wasn’t a unique reaction by those living through this dangerous but thrilling time.<br><br>Churchill was maddening to work for, especially if you were on call at all hours every day. But those close to him recognized the importance and uniqueness of his leadership and were very loyal.<br><br>Larson paints vivid portraits of advisors who were characters in their own right, chief among them Canadian Lord Beaverbrook, who was given the task of organizing British aircraft production. He found it woefully behind that of the Germans but soon boosted output so that British production overtook that of the enemy and was capable of more than replacing every plane the Luftwaffe managed to shoot down. As a measure of how disorganized the British were before Beaverbrook took charge, Churchill was maddened to discover that at the height of the Blitz the Aircraft Ministry could not account for 3,000 of its own planes that had come off the assembly line, never mind not knowing the strength of the Luftwaffe. Beaverbrook’s organizational genius was exceeded only by his ego, and he resigned 14 times before Churchill finally accepted.<br><br>A second larger than life character was Frederick Lindemann, “The Prof,” whose scientific insights were held in higher regard by Churchill than by many other scientists and engineers of the time. Lindemann correctly got Churchill to focus on the importance of radar and the navigation signals that the Germans were developing to guide bombers to their target at night and in poor weather. But both Churchill and Lindemann became enamored of the concept of a curtain of aerial mines that might be dropped in front of incoming fleets of German bombers. At their insistence, scarce resources continued to be allocated to the project even when it was clear that the idea was unworkable.<br><br>Churchill was a clever tactician. When Chamberlain resigned, many — including King George VI — would have preferred Lord Halifax as prime minister. To rid himself of a rival, Churchill appointed Halifax as British ambassador to the United States, despite Halifax’s remonstrations. “I don’t think it’s particularly my line of country,” Halifax pleaded, “and I have never liked Americans except for the odd one. In the main, I have thought them dreadful.” Ironically, Halifax was an effective ambassador and came to play a crucial role in getting America to send war materials to the then beleaguered Britain.<br><br>Better known is Churchill’s early belief that Britain would only prevail if America could be persuaded to enter the war. While this was not achieved during the period covered by the book, and only after Pearl Harbor, Larson does quote Churchill’s famous observation, “No lover ever studied every whim of his mistress as I did those of President Roosevelt.”<br><br>Larson provides an intimate portrait of a complicated, inspirational leader within the context of a most dramatic period of British history. The author’s talent is to provide a highly personal and readable insight into Churchill and his times.</span>",Life with Churchill in the Blitz,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLHXRR2FT6X2TH3MIWW34FKW6KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It was a bit hard to read in part because of the pandemic we are still struggling with. However, it was such a story of human strength, determination and victory that I found it uplifting.<br><br>I had never researched Winston Churchill in the past and knew him only by brief articles about him or short films. In reading an article by the author I found that after he visited New York he suddenly understood how New Yorkers felt about 9/11, it was an attack on their home city that none of us living elsewhere could truly understand. He then began to think of London and “the aerial assault of 1940-41 in which they endured 57 consecutive nights of bombing, followed by an intensifying series of nighttime raids over the next six months.”<br><br>It was then that he decided to write this book and focus on Churchill’s 1st year as prime minister and what it must have felt like to have his city invaded from the sea and sky. “This was the year that Churchill became Churchill, the cigar smoking bulldog we all think we know, when he made his greatest speeches and showed the world what courage and leadership looked like”. Wow what an incredible achievement of research and smooth flowing prose this book is. I learned about what Churchill’s family life was like and how much they struggled. There are also many characters, ordinary citizens, and what it was like for them, to know that when nighttime came the bombing would start again.<br><br>Reading this book transported me to England and showed me what a unifying leader Mr. Churchill was, how much the populace loved him and how he walked among the ruins and wept openly.

He said in his afterword, “As I’ve discovered with prior books, when you look at the past through a fresh lens, you invariably see the world differently and find new material and insights even along well-trodden paths.”<br><br>I knew about Mary’s willfulness, I knew about Pamela’s disastrous marriage to Randolph and her affair with Harriman, and Randolph’s debauchery, but this is Winston’s book.  He had a quirky habit of conducting business from the bathtub and sometimes while butt naked, even with President Roosevelt.  His secretary John Coville found it endearing that he wasn’t encumbered by personal vanity.  (We watch our infant granddaughter two days a week and I’ve been reading this book to her at nap times.  It knocks her right out but I keep reading because research says this is good for a baby’s brain.)<br><br>It was the incidental things that kept me picking this book up after a break every now and then, because that first year was so bloody bloody. “Between September 7, 1940, when the first large-scale attack on central London occurred, and Sunday morning, May 11, 1941, when the Blitz came to an end, nearly 29,000 of its citizens were killed, and 28,556 seriously injured.”  That’s just one year!<br><br>Larson fleshed out his narrative with events like a moving gesture after the war had ended. Jubilant Londoners poured into the streets “and searchlight operators aimed their lights at the space in the air just above the cross that topped the dome to St Paul’s Cathedral and held them there, to form a shining cross of light.”  Or new tidbits, like Hitler declared war on America on December 11th - and then we reciprocated.  I thought it was the other way around.<br><br>But always, it was Winston’s story, his determination, his work habits taking him into the wee hours of the morning, his boyishness.  A teenage boy was setting up a train set for his grandson, making sure it all worked, and the next thing he knew, the PM was on the floor with him, testing, trying.  “NOW, let’s have a crash!”  What a remarkable man, one in a million.</span>",Gripping,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGD4GGBWDGFUSVMQHQOLNOU5YGFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.<br><br>This book is written in true Erik Larson form – superb!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Mr. Larson’s previous books or likes World War II non-fiction or information about Churchill.  The primary focus of the book is around Britain’s fight for survival under Germany’s attacks.  Churchill’s critical efforts that helped Britain’s people’s moral, world communication, courage, and constant efforts were instrumental in Britain surviving until the United States joined the war.<br><br>Chapters share Germany’s perspective as well as interesting aspects of Hitler and his underlings, such as Goring, Goebbels, and a Luftwaffe pilot, Galland.  The author does a great job enlightening the reader of the human nature of all characters – British and German.  There is a social aspect with dancing, partying and enjoying life while bombing is going on.  One minute a young person may be dancing and the next minute dead.  Bombing blackouts made “life easier for the pickpockets who frequented train stations and for the looters who plucked valuables.”<br><br>Honestly, this book is much more than about Churchill.  There are stories that get left out of many of Churchill’s biographies.  You learn details about the lives of Churchill’s family, friends, staff including his inner circle.  His lodgings at Chequers, Ditchley, and 10 Downing Street.  His efforts to influence Roosevelt for American assistance is a constant.  There are frequent Churchill “nuggets” that I didn’t know before reading this book such as “Churchill would wander the halls wearing a red dressing gown, a helmet, and slippers with pom-poms.”  “Churchill … idiosyncrasies, including his penchant for wearing pink silk underwear, working in the bathtub, and drinking throughout the day.”  By the conclusion of the book, I felt like I had an entirely new insight into Churchill’s idiosyncrasies.  With the heaviness of the topic, Larson was able to find humor with tidbits of nuggets.  The Britain bombings are descriptive with details on bombs and German attacks.<br><br>The Epilogue gives us the “rest of the story” of characters.  This is not “just another WWII” book.

During the Blitz, Londoners endured fifty-seven consecutive nights of bombing.  Tens of thousands of people died. How did the people endure such a terrifying ordeal? What was it like living day after day knowing that during the night the bombs would rain down and you might be one of the many who would die?<br><br>How did they endure? Churchill’s determination, unrelenting optimism, and eloquent speeches  encouraged the people and gave them hope. He emboldened them to realize the part they played in this moment in history. Amid the sheer terror of the relentless bombings, Churchill was an extraordinary leader and a beacon of hope.<br><br>Churchill was a brilliant orator who never wavered in telling the people the hard truth, but always  followed with optimism and an unwavering conviction that England would prevail.  His courage was inspiring and his is a picture of true leadership. But he was also a man who had his flaws, quirks,  and idiosyncrasies. There was opposition to appointing him as Prime Minister, but at this particular moment in history he was the right man for the job and he got it right.<br><br>Covering Winston Churchill’s first year in office, between May 1940 and May 1941,  Larson, known for his exhaustive research,  used  personal journals, archival documents, and intelligence reports.  Through these we learn of the everyday lives of ordinary citizens, as well as those of Churchill, his family, and the people closest to him.  No family is perfect, including Churchill’s. The stories of his wife Clementine, his daughter Mary (who ended up being one of my favorite characters!) , his son Randall, and daughter-in-law Pamela, provided much of the human interest stories, making this such a readable book. Though the subject is grim, there’s no shortage of humorous personal interest stories.<br><br>Plenty of books have been written about WWII and The Blitz, but only Erik Larson can tell it in an original way that makes history come alive. I felt as if I lived this story with these characters. It reads like a thrilling novel, but every word, every conversation,  is true, and I wasn’t ready for the book to end.  Larson writes history for people who think they don’t like history.<br><br>This is a true gem, don’t miss it!<br><br>* I received a free digital copy via NetGalley.

Jeez, dude, a toaster oven?! A single anecdote does not, of course, a national character make but you gotta wonder about how we stand compared to Britain in those dark years. This reminds me of George McGovern's (bomber pilot in WWII and, later, US Prez candidate) comment (heavily paraphrased) that, as long as he wasn't being shot at, everything was just fine.<br><br>So, an excellent book to read not only to remember the sacrifice and bravery of ordinary people in their day to day lives amidst death and terror, but to remind us of the very meaning of sacrifice, the importance of leadership in a time of crisis, and the need for perspective when the trumpet summons us to carry small burdens for our common good. (yes, yes, small tip of the hat to JFK great inaugural).<br><br>Winston Churchill, of course, is always the center of any story about WWII -- or, really, anything he's involved in. But I found his daughter, Mary, to be compelling. Her diary entries are quoted extensively. As a 17 year old at the start of the war, she's kind of a ditzy and, really, typical teenager from a very privileged family and society. Although I think not given much credit by those around her (family and aides to Winston) she soon joins an anti-aircraft crew and also accompanies Winston to conferences as his aide-de-camp. A coming-of-age in microcosm for Britain and, ultimately, the world.<br><br>It's these contemporary diary entries from those surrounding Churchill that make this book great and a valuable addition to what's too often a Churchill hagiography.

For some, this is only an entertainment, as history is seen as determined by forces much larger than the interesting personalities who briefly populate the stage.<br><br>But for me, I do think the personalities of the great figures of history can be determinative -- like dice in a backgammon game or the luck of the draw in poker.  They provide the random element that can determine history.<br><br>Here, England survived alone against the Nazis primarily because of the geopolitical advantage of the English Channel; their great Navy; their vastly underestimated but magnificent air force; and the stability of their political system.  But it did not have to be that way.  The random element of a different Prime Minister could have led to a different result.  Not that a cross channel invasion could have succeeded given the German's woeful lack of landing boats (which was challenging enough for the Americans to achieve after two years of effort) and a weak Navy -- and lack of clear air superiority.  But there could have been a negotiation.<br><br>What if Halifax were P.M. or if the English suffered some of the dispirited political fighting and poor generalship that sunk the French?  The French, after all, had as large an Army as Germany, and their tanks were as good if not better.<br><br>So Larson's study is useful history, not just an entertainment.  Churchill provides a magnificent study in leadership and how to rally the nation with the right words and, more importantly, the right heart that could be sensed by the nation.<br><br>Churchill is a complex figure.  His leadership after the Blitz can be questioned, as has recently been done in Nigel Hamilton's three volume study of FDR.  And Churchill's conduct in India and penchant for empire will continue to cost him with future historians.  But the Blitz was Churchill's finest hour and Larson certainly brings him to life.</span>",Entertaining and Compelling History that Vindicates Churchill and the British,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7PGOEVD2ZKMF34WJSFURB2P7RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It focuses on the immediate members of Churchill's circle and offers an up-close-and-personal look at the experience of 1940-41.  The principal players are Churchill, his wife Clementine, daughter Mary, Lord Beaverbrook, the 'Prof' (Frederick Lindemann), Jock Colville, Pamela Digby Churchill (later Harriman), with nice cameos featuring Harry Hopkins and Harriman himself.  We catch the Germans through a number of interesting glimpses (Hitler, Goebbels, Hess, Göring) and an air ace named Adolph Galland.<br><br>We see WSC himself in states of elation as well as in the doldrums and we obtain a feel for both his personal relationships and the city itself, under siege.  This is not 'suspenseful' per se (history with all of the impact of the best fiction) since we all know how it comes out.  This is more top flight social history, like David Lough's absolutely splendid book, NO MORE CHAMPAGNE; CHURCHILL AND HIS MONEY (though the truly profligate spender and gambler here is WSC's son, Randolph).<br><br>The research that undergirds the book is extensive and, like any serious book on WSC, involves a preliminary reading of vast amounts of material.  This book will please all students of modern British history, all students of WSC and all students of twentieth-century warfare.<br><br>The author converts dollar and sterling amounts to contemporary numbers.  This is very helpful and always startling.  The personal lives of individuals are explored honestly but not salaciously and the writing is completely effective throughout.  I only note one quibble.  On board the Duke of York WSC writes to his wife that ""Being in a ship in such weather as this is like being in a prison, with the extra chance of being drowned.""  This wonderful reflection on naval life is not credited to its original source—Samuel Johnson.<br><br>Highly recommended.</span>",Splendid Stuff,

Erik Larson's terrific book proved me wrong. While many books have been written by and about the major players, especially those by and about the major player, Winston Churchill, Larson takes a unique approach.<br><br>He chooses the first year of Churchill's term as Prime Minister, beginning in May 1940. During that time, Germany's Luftwaffe conducted nearly sixty bombing raids, first hitting strategic military targets and eventually destroying nearly the entire city of Coventry and much of London, while killing thousands of innocent civilians. The author chooses to use as his primary sources the personal journals of Churchill's family members and various men and women close to him, such as Lord Beaverbrook, John Colville, and Professor Lindemann to focus on the human aspects of the battle. From these, we learn about the love lives of young daughter Mary Churchill, daughter-in-law Pamela, and wayward son Randolph. Churchill's secretary, John Colville, tells of the continuing struggle of the PM to woo President Franklin D. Roosevelt--the balancing act of trying to convince FDR of Britain's desperate need for assistance without giving the impression that his country is about to lose the war. Larson even cites the journals of some of the Nazi leaders, as well one of their top air aces, such that we experience the Battle of Britain from the side of the aggressor as well.<br><br>Numbering just under 600 pages, I expected parts of the book to be a slog. No such problem! As in his other books, Larson manages to give a nonfiction book the pace and excitement of a novel.

This compelling portrait shows in a cinematic way how Churchill taught the British people the art of being fearless. The story is more than a political one it also tells us the domestic drama and the day to day experience of Churchill, his family and his inner circle.<br><br>We are taken in a time of unrelenting horror with eloquence. Mr. Larson artfully weaves a tapestry of events, speeches, daily routines and tells us how the Prime Minister was determined in his pursuit to obtain aide from the USA and how it was up to him to hold his country together during Hitler’s relentless bombing campaign. Mr. Larson is definitely a master of narrative non-fiction work.<br><br>Although the Battle of Britain has been told many times there are always new discoveries and some omissions.

Larson delves into Churchill's personal life, his triumphs, his shortcomings, and everything in between.  Larson also details the other people close to Churchill that keep the war engines running in England including the man who led the manufacture and upkeep of the RAF fleet and those men who attempted to thwart Germany's radar and targeting technology and therefore disrupt the effectiveness of Germany's constant bombing raids.<br>  Larson, by doing extensive research, has created a narrative in the book that provides a fascinating and unique insight, but all the while entertaining and vibrant, not dull and dryly factual like many nonfiction books can be.  So many of the little tidbits make the book engaging, like Lord Beaverbrook, who served as the Minister of Aircraft Production, announced to Churchill he was resigning his post every so often, which Larson posits was, in part, a rouse Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill had because they enjoyed challenging each other.  Larson's ability to further his opinion of what happened not by fictitious storytelling but by using the facts in his favor is masterful.<br>  When I finished THE SPLENDID AND THE VILE, I felt well educated in the events surrounding Churchill's first year in office.

""The Splendid and the Vile"" was the first book of Mr. Larson's that I have read. I was amazed at the intricate detail Larson put into every part of this book. The book was well researched and contains details from all kinds of records such as diarist's notes, journals from key figure such as Winston Churchill himself, or his many associates and assistants such as Hastings ""Pug"" Ismay, Max Beaverbrook, and family members such as his daughter Mary Churchill, or his daughter-in-law Pamela Churchill.<br><br>The book is not for the faint of heart as it tops out at 585 pages and is so detailed that the vast breadth of it covers Churchill's time as the UK Prime Minister from May 1940 until xx 1941, less than two years that spans the time in Britain during the Battle for Britain. This battle consisted of numerous fighter pilot encounters in the skies above the UK and the horrifying air raids and bombings by the German Luftwaffe. These bombings were expected to be a prelude to Germany's ground invasion of the British Isles, which at the outset of his tenure as Prime Minister seemed to be imminent.<br><br>Interspersing Churchill's iconic addresses to Parliament and the British people with the events leading up to his rousing speeches is used to great dramatic effect by Larson in recounting the details unfolding throughout his book.

It initially began as a search for my husband’s roots in Scandinavia and colonial America, but I eventually began to trace my own family history in what is now the United Kingdom. I’ve uncovered where my paternal great-grandfather fought during the Great War but didn’t think there was much on his son – my grandfather – because he wasn’t in the military. It turns out that he was in a reserved occupation – a bit like an essential worker during the current coronavirus pandemic – but he was in the Auxiliary Fire Service in London during World War 2. His older brother, my great uncle, was listed in the 1939 Register as being trained as an Air Raid Warden. Both lived in south London and both survived the war. That got me wondering what life might’ve been like for them and their wives at that time. Erik Larsen’s latest book, although focusing on the British government from 1940 to 1941, has now given me some idea.<br><br>The introduction (or prologue) is titled Bleak Expectations, not exactly an optimistic starting point. It reveals that British government officials planned for a worst-case scenario if Germany decided to bomb or invade the country. There is something to be said about this method. Although a bleak picture is painted, we feel better when these expectations don’t come to pass. I only need to look at the case projections for New York during this Coronavirus pandemic and compare it to the actual numbers to experience that, especially in New York. But on another hand, we never seem to learn our lessons regarding preparedness. Whereas now there are discussion points about whether the world was prepared for such a situation, back then there was an acknowledgment of a shortage of planes and anti-aircraft defenses. Things weren’t looking good when Winston Churchill came to power on 10th May 1940, and this is where Larson starts proceedings before looking at events of the Dunkirk evacuation just two weeks later.<br><br>But the Dunkirk evacuation is also where Churchill set the tone for the war and the war effort. The Prime Minister believed in showing confidence and fearlessness and that such attitudes could spread. Churchill didn’t believe in minimizing events, but he portrayed confidence that they could be overcome. This was highlighted in his famous “We Shall Fight on the Beaches” speech on 4th June 1940. Larson uses primary sources such as personal diaries to show the reaction to that speech and many others.<br><br>Personal diaries provide vital clues to life in 1940 and 1941. Reading the entries makes me hope that somewhere down the road, 22nd century historians will be able to reflect on 2020 using similar sources. As well as writings from Churchill family members, private secretaries, and other associates, Larson makes use of entries from Mass-Observation, which relied on volunteers to keep diaries about everyday life. Some entries made me cringe for their frivolity; it seems crazy that so many young people – including Churchill’s youngest daughter – laughed, danced, and drank champagne while so many of their countrymen (and women) were dying either in battle or because of the blitz. There were many occasions when Churchill and company would watch the blitz from the roofs of government buildings. The title of the book comes from a line in Sir Jock Colville’s diary where he described watching bombs falling over London at night as both “splendid” and “vile.” But other entries, described the resilience of the people, how they got on with daily life while the bombs fell over an eight-month period, and how they cheered their Prime Minister when they saw him. Who knows, maybe my grandparents and other relatives were among them.<br><br>The Splendid and the Vile clocks in at over 600 pages, but it didn’t feel like that many. The contents page shows a daunting 101 chapters, plus epilogue. It isn’t all that bad, however. Many of the chapters are short, with some being only one page long. Plus, almost twenty percent of the book is comprised of sources, acknowledgements, and notes. It means that, even if some of the sentences are long with several clauses, it’s a reasonably easy read. I’m a focused reader, so it took me just over one week to read. Because it can be broken down into bite size chunks, it’s a book that can be picked up and put down at will. This was the third of Larson’s books that I’ve read, and it’s probably the one I’ve enjoyed the best.<br><br>Disclaimer: Although I received an electronic uncorrected proof of this book from the publisher via NetGalley, the words and opinions are my own.</span>",Personal Diaries Can Tell Us a Lot,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJHRJFVCNDSEJ2NGGY4M4RQ3F6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

He has accomplished this with every highly anticipated literary endeavor of his.  Sit back and watch the magnificence of Winston Churchill ....  what unfolds is an intimate glimpse into the first year of his position as the Prime Minister of England, during it's most harrowing time in history, surviving a relentless bombing campaign of Hitler's Germany killing more than 45,000 Britons. Through usage of diaries, original archival documents and recently released intelligence reports., Larson weaves a narrative with mounting tension and mystery worthy of the finest literary novel..  What unfolds is a moving account of not only the behind the scene look into the lives of everyday Britons, but also the inner workings and feelings of Churchill and those of his inner circle and family.  A stark look and portrait of not only London under the Blitz, but also 10 Downing Street , and his weekend retreats, at Checquers and Ditchley.  Churchill's main secretary, John Colville kept a diary chocked full of operational secrets and insights to Churchill's behavior  that  would have been a prize if fallen into a German agents hand.  This account is a testimony to Churchill's strange power to bring forth courage and strength in the most trying of circumstances.

Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for providing an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review. As Larson writes in the intro, “History is a lively abode, full of surprises.”<br>  Larson deserves to have his books at the top of the non-fiction charts. His writing is clear, well-researched, factual, organized and personal. The huge volumes of research on Churchill and this time period are distilled into a fascinating story sprinkled with intriguing facts. The story covers both sides of WWII in 1940, focusing mostly on Churchill, his family and colleagues.<br>  After France fell to the Germans, England braced for invasion. “Sandbags and guns adorned the grounds of Buckingham Palace, where the masses of tulips in the place gardens were…’exactly the color of blood.’ The queen began taking lessons in how to shoot a revolver. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I shall not go down like the others.’” The excellent details never get tedious, a real art in a lengthy historical work.<br>  Describing the aftermath of an air raid Larson writes, “It was this dust that many Londoners remembered as being one of the most striking phenomena of this attack and of others that followed. As buildings erupted, thunderheads of pulverized brick, stone, plaster, and mortar billowed from eaves and attics, roofs and chimneys, hearths and furnaces – dust from the age of Cromwell, Dickens, and Victoria.”  I so appreciate such crafted writing.  Too often it’s a lost art these days of quick reads. Larson describes the two eternal weapons of Russia as “its sheer size and its winter weather.” Brilliant. The subtlest tidbits of humor and phrases pop up and illuminate.<br>  The London Blitz was a dark time, but it was also a time when the British dug in, helped each other and ‘Carried On.’  “Diana Cooper, wife of Information Minister Duff Cooper, told Churchill that the best thing he had done was to give people courage. He did not agree. ‘I never gave them courage,’ he said. ‘I was able to focus theirs.’”</span>",splendid and fascinating story about London Blitz,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHOA4TGALSJ2L33XVG3WAI6NI27A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

My answer is ""Yes. He is both.""<br><br>In his latest book, Larson focuses on Winston Churchill's first year as Prime Minister from May 10, 1940, until May 10, 1941, ""which coincided with the German air campaign as it evolved from the sporadic, seemingly aimless raids to a full-on assault against the city of London."" In life as in accounts of his life, Churchill dominates the narrative. He is lovable in some situations and insufferable in many others. He has a few moments of doubt but always, somehow, quickly returns to form with a determination that enabled his country to survive its ""darkest hour."" <br><br>Among Larson's greatest talents is his ability to bring relatively minor historical figures to life. In alpha order, they include Lord Beaverbrook (head of aircraft production and a Churchill confidante), Churchill's wife Clementine and Pamela Churchill (wife of son Randolp Churchill), Major General Hastings Ismay, ""Pug"" or ""Secret Circle"" (Churchill's military chief of staff), Frederick Lindemann, ""Prof"" (Churchill's iconocast-in-residence),  (John (""Jock"") Colville (one of two Churchill secretaries), Joseph Goebbels (Hitler's chief propagandist), Hermann Göring (chief of the Luftwaffe), Harry Hopkins (FDR's emissary and confidante), and William Averell Harriman (Corporate mogul, coordinator of U.S. aid, and FDR's ""observer"" in London).. They especially as qwell as many others enrich and enlighten the course of events.<br><br>Early in the book, Larson cites the fact the new prime minister went to bed that first night at 10 Downing Street, ""Alive with a thrilling sense of challenge and opportunity...He felt great relief. 'At last I had the authority to give directions over the whole scene. I felt as if I were walking with destiny, and that all my past life had been but a preparation for this hour and this trial...Although impatient for the morning I slept soundly and had no need for cheering dreams. Facts are better than dreams."" Whatever awaited him, Churchill knew he was ready...and no one else on the planet was better prepared to be and do whatever was necessary to achieve ""the ultimate victory.""<br><br>As is also true of Erik Larson's other books, The Splendid and the Vile is as entertaining as it is informative. When I began to read the final chapter, there was again a sense of dread as I reluctantly approached what I knew would be ""Finis.""</span>",Popular narrative nonfiction of the very highest order,

In the Splendid and the Vile, Larsen pieces together hundreds of historical accounts, interviews, and passages from personal diaries to give the reader an understanding of how the British survived the Battle of Briton. In typical Larsen fashion, he interweaves multiple stories to show the reality of life during the war. Both the good and the bad.<br>The book focuses on the role that Winston Churchill played in keeping the British from succumbing to the superior German armies when most of Europe had capitulated. He takes the time to show the reader not only the tragedy of war but the psychology that was prevalent on both the British and German sides of the battles. Intermixed with the war he relays to us how people tried to maintain a sense of normalcy and grace while the world crumbled before them.<br>I must applaud Larsen for all of his hard work. The research involved to make this book, as evidenced by the 50-page Bibliography, must have been exhausting.<br>At the same time, I found the book at times hard to read. His sentences were often lengthy requiring me to have to go back and read them again and again to understand the point he was trying to make. I also found his style, which I am familiar with, to be a little confusing. Time and again he seemed to insert little tidbits of information that did not seem relevant to the moment. It was as if he was saying “I have all of this great information, but I don’t know where it would best fit.”<br>The book offers a much greater appreciation for the duress that the British faced and how Churchill led them to victory.<br>All in all, it is a tremendous learning experience for anyone that has an interest in modern history.

I got it to learn more about Churchill, and I did, but it was less a portrait of Winston Churchill the man, and more the story of the country of England holding on when Nazi Germany was controlling the rest of Europe. It was about surviving the nightly bombings, and the decisions that gave England a chance to survive. There is very little about Churchill's wife Clementine, and just a little more about his daughter, Mary. I had wanted a more intimate portrait of the family, but still found the war through English eyes to be fascinating. Recently, I had read No Ordinary Time by Doris Kearns Goodwin, about FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt during the war. Erik Larson is a very good writer, but no one makes historical characters come alive like Kearns Goodwin. I was worried about listening to both books so close together, but they made great companion pieces. My biggest complaint about the audiobook is the narrator. He does a great voice when speaking for Churchill, but when he switches back to third person, his sharp, staccato voice was really irritating, especially at first. Then, like the smell of manure at a farm, I just got used to it, and stopped being so annoyed. Erik Larson's book does make history come alive. I recommend it. There is a lot to inspire in this book!</span>",Very good history - WW2 from English eyes,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQTVUFJQ4CVXXJ2IWP2JTL3RNRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

The book is advertised as being about Winston Churchill and WWII, but this is misleading. It is really about an entire milieu. You come away feeling as though you know Churchill's teenage daughter, his secretaries, ambassadors, young scientists, fighter pilots. What emerges is not a book about war, but a book about people in a time of war (there is a big difference). Larson draws significantly from personal diaries, so in a very real way you get to hear the dead speak. They go to dances even as bombs are falling, they fall in love, they make mistakes and experience humiliations. They witness gruesome deaths.<br><br>Like Londoners in 1939 we too are subject to frightening news and discouraging odds: a deadly pandemic, minimal resources, a collapsing economy, panic.

His meticulous research, coupled with a conversational writing style, make his nonfiction books as enjoyable to read as a novel. He tells the reader about Churchill, but more importantly, we get to know people around him: his wife, his 18-year- old daughter, his spendthrift son, and most importantly, his entourage, all of whom worked tirelessly during the war years.  The descriptions elicit a very visceral reaction—I felt almost as if I were a witness to the terrible bombings—but there are moments when he also injects humor. (Roosevelt sent his emissary Harry Hopkins to meet with Churchill in 1940; Churchill took him to review the fleet on a very cold, blustery day. Hopkins “looked for a place to shelter …from the cold and wind…and found a spot that seemed ideal. A chief petty officer approached him, saying ‘Excuse me sir, I don’t think you should sit there—that, sir, is a depth charge.’”)<br>I highly recommend The Splendid and the Vile, not only to readers with an interest in history, but also to those who usually don’t care for nonfiction.</span>",Exceptional,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBG2H55LSS2NH4XS5SSNEHKTMAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I know there are a ton of books on Churchill, but I've never read them. I've also never really taken the time to learn much about the Bombing of Britain. This book combined so much I didn't know into a wonderful narrative filled with direct quotations, whether it be from diaries or speeches. Even though I clearly know the outcome of the war and know that the Nazi's did not end up invading; it was still fascinating to read about Churchill and how he came into office the day the Hitler invaded Belgium and Holland. The way he led Britain was inspiring and Erik Larson does a wonderful job of writing about how passionate, persuasive (and peculiar) he was. I definitely want to go read more now!

I would have to say that it is much more splendid than it is vile. The book is subtitled: “A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz.” I have read several books about Churchill. Many of them touch upon his quirks, his temper and his fabulous oratory ability, and all that is to be found in Larson’s book as well. But Larson delves more deeply into Churchill’s family and personal relationships.<br><br>The book focuses on Churchill’s first year in office as Prime Minister. And what a terrible first year it was for Britain. The lion’s share of Nazi bombing raids on Britain took place during that first year.  The enormity of the Blitz is something that I don’t think anyone can really grasp if they didn’t go through it. And the people of England, especially London, went through it night after relentless night. I was reminded of Connie Willis’ science fiction novel Blackout which lets you feel just an inkling of what it must have been like to live in London during the blitz.<br><br>During this same year, the British military suffered defeat after defeat.  Hitler really didn’t want to bother with England. He wanted a peace treaty with the British so he could go after Russia. But those pesky British just wouldn’t give in (this delayed his timetable and was probably good for Russia). Very few people (if anyone else) could have withstood the continuous barrage of bad news day after day and still kept their seat as Prime Minister. That Churchill did, shows just what a force of nature he was.<br><br>I don’t want to give the impression that Larson gives us nothing but gloom and doom. This is an eminently readable book. In fact, it reads almost like a novel. There is a defined cast of characters that we follow. Some of those characters we root for and are keen to find out what happens to them. Besides Churchill, there is his daughter Mary who is just seventeen as the book begins. She has the joie de vivre that many seventeen-year-olds have. We follow one of Churchill’s secretaries, John Colville, who was not a fan of Churchill at the beginning, but we watch as his admiration grows. There is Churchill’s daughter-in-law Pamela, who had the misfortune to be married to Churchill’s hard drinking, hard gambling son Randall. We see Churchill’s relationships with his friends, both personal and professional. He put his friend Lord Beaverbrook in charge of aircraft production. Despite much ill feeling toward Beaverbrook, this turned out to be absolutely the right move. Another friend of Churchill’s “the prof” Frederick Lindemann became his scientific advisor. We follow love lives, ambition, frivolity, envy; in short, all the things that make up the human condition, which continued to happen even in the throes of a terrible war.<br><br>I very much enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by Erik Larson.</span>",Splendid,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYN2ZN7ALOWEHWU55KPYNWOB7FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

I found that to be the case once again with The Splendid and the Vile. Winston Churchill's first year as prime minister of England was nothing short of a social, political, and emotional roller coaster ride almost beyond description. Erik Larson scores a triumph by doing so in his riveting account of a year when England, led by the indomitable Churchill, was holding on by a thread. The writing is incredible! The chapter on the bombing of Coventry literally left me gasping. I give this work five stars without any hesitation whatsoever. However, that being said, I wish the book had contained a few illustrations. I found myself looking online for pictures of William Averell Harriman, Lord Beaverbrook, Harry Hopkins, Chequers, and Ditchley. I realize that this is a minor shortcoming, but it would have enhanced the work. An excellent read!

The author of The Devil in the White City and In the Garden of Beasts (my favorite book in the last 10 years), vividly describes Churchill, Hitler, and the London Blitz. Although a tad long and occasionally over-detailed, Larson's rare sin is a little too much of a very good thing: extremely well-researched historical facts and excerpts from documents, speeches, memoirs, and unpublished letters and diaries woven exquisitely into a story-telling tapestry that reads like spy fiction. His descriptions of Churchill and his circles of advisors and family members is fascinating, as are the corresponding specifics on Goebbels, Goering, Hess, and -- here and there -- Hitler. In between, we learn plenty about the regular folks in London and how they survived the Battle of Britain: with chins up, spirits high, and soothed constantly by tea.

I felt like I was able to see the war from a new perspective of Herman Goerring and Hitler as a tactical means to their growing empire - rather than the often emotional and “evil” nature often depicted in WW2 stories and films. (Not that their actions were any less evil because of this new perspective).<br><br>The author has a few semantics that become repetitive throughout the book, especially at the end of the chapters that I wish were not so frequent.

Larson presents the intensity of that time with skill. We can almost feel the German bombs falling on England. Lord Beaverbrook, Professor Lindemann and many others deliver for Churchill and country.

Bestselling author Erik Larson weaves a gripping tale of Winston Churchill, the newly elected British Prime Minister, and those in his orbit during Germany’s bombing of the U.K. in World War II.  With his distinctive style, Larson brings many people back to life, often relying on their own accounts, which gives us a personal glimpse into this moment of history.<br><br>Although Larson’s storytelling is tremendously entertaining, we can't forget the horror of the devastation, 44,652 civilian deaths, and even more people injured, during the fateful days of 1940 and 1941, as the writer pointed out.  Larson’s account of the bombing of Coventry is a moment when it all becomes real, a shift in tone from anecdotes about Churchill, his staff and family, and cunning Nazis with devious strategies. By no means does Larson gloss over the awfulness, but the irony is always that engaging books are written about ghastly times, about endless wars that our species won’t forsake.  But these stories must be retold, and we are forever grateful to storytellers like Larson.

Larsen uses quotes from diaries and letters to elevate the story above the facts and figures and dates and make it personal, populated with well-rounded personalities acting and reacting to events impossible to comprehend. He even almost succeeds at making Churchill himself into someone anyone can identify with. Yet the apparent reality of Churchill defies the attempt and he remains larger-than-life. This is a must-read for anyone interested in this period of history.<br><br>Disclosure: Thank you to Netgalley and Crown Publishing for providing a free copy of this book in return for my honest review.</span>",Captivating tale of the Blitz and Winston Churchill's first year as PM,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPQT6F2KELZTPH263NEQXF4R4OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

And his vocalization of women’s speech is also peculiar; he makes them sound simpering and breathy. It reminds of the way adolescent boys sometimes imitate their mothers, minus the falsetto.

Why I didn't give this the full 5 stars is that I got the impression that the author either ran out of steam or lost interest as the period portrayed comes to a close, finally finishing with sketch-like remarks on what subsequently happened to many of the players.

The hugely best-selling author of Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania; In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler’s Berlin; and Isaac’s Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History has once more captured an iconic historical moment and brought it vividly to life in near-novelistic prose, yet without inventing a single thing. Dry-as-dust historians, often in the Academy, have a great deal to learn from writers such as Larson, who are introducing the public to the splendor and terror of the past in vast numbers without compromising one iota on fact.<br>The Splendid and the Vile is the story of the London Blitz, starting from the moment that Winston Churchill became prime minister on May 10, 1940, until the Luftwaffe raid that destroyed the parts of the House of Commons exactly one year later, coincidentally on the same night that Rudolf Hess flew to Scotland.<br><br>A Year in the Life<br><br>Although Churchill’s family were all brave, this is no hagiography. We are told that Churchill’s son, Randolph, missed the birth of his son by his wife, Pamela, for example, because he was “in bed with the wife of an Austrian tenor, whose monocled image appeared on cigarette trading cards.” Pamela, understandably, was soon sleeping with Franklin Roosevelt’s tall, rich, and impossibly handsome envoy, Averell Harriman, about whom a female reporter told his daughter Kathleen, “For g. sake tell your father next time I have to cover his conference to wear a gas mask so’s I can concentrate on what he’s saying.""<br>Larson makes excellent use of the diary of Mary Soames, Churchill’s delightful (and morally pure) daughter, which resides at the Churchill Archives Centre at Cambridge University, meaning there is new information in this book. His work in the British National Archives has been acute and painstaking, too, and despite writing books on World War II for 30 years I learned a good deal, for instance that only four percent of Londoners used the subways as air-raid shelters, and that cooperative German P.O.W.’s were taken around the Blitzed areas to see how high British morale still was. “Prisoners saw for themselves that London was not lying in ruins as they had been led to believe,” stated one intelligence report, and the process made the P.O.W.’s more cooperative. In late 1942, a captured Luftwaffe officer told interrogators that if German intelligence reports were accurate, the R.A.F. and Allied Forces must by now have “minus 500 aircraft.”<br>Larson does fine work in countering many revisionist myths about Churchill, such as the libel that he knew about the raid on Coventry in November 1940 but deliberately did nothing to warn the city in order to protect the Ultra decrypting operation, and he similarly dismisses the various conspiracy theories about the Hess flight. For however zippy is Mr. Larson’s prose—there are 101 chapters in 608 pages—facts are sacrosanct to him.<br>Nor does this book shy away from the vile side of the Blitz: the looting and the thieving; the occasional, but thankfully isolated, outbreaks of people’s depression and defeatism; the extremely basic lavatory facilities in the subway bomb shelters; and so on. He also focuses on the vile Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring, and the parts they hoped to play in London’s destruction. Goebbels sent out radio messages intended to make people fear there was a large Fascist fifth column helping the Luftwaffe, for example, hoping that Londoners hunched around their radios would suspiciously ask one another, “Why did that news reader just say porridge for the sixth time?”<br>There are plenty of humorous moments in this book, too. In September 1940, King George VI and his private secretary, Alec Hardinge, were almost killed in the bombing of Buckingham Palace. “The whole thing happened in a matter of seconds,” the King wrote of the bomb blast in the quadrangle only a few yards away. “We all wondered why we weren’t dead.” Yet the police constable guarding the palace viewed it remarkably objectively, telling the Queen that it had been “a magnificent piece of bombing.”<br><br>His Finest Hours<br><br>The personality that looms over the whole book is that of Churchill himself, who was taking life-or-death decisions on virtually a daily basis. Early on he was forced to decide whether to evacuate the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, and whether to send the R.A.F. across the Channel for the Battle of France, then raging, or retain it at home for the far more important Battle of Britain to come. Later on he faced equally tough choices about how to counter the daily-expected invasion. What emerges powerfully is that with him in charge, London would have been defended street by street, house by house, brick by brick. As Churchill said, the capital could have “swallowed” an entire German army, just as Stalingrad later did.<br><br>As I read this book, I kept wondering what the swelling of powerful emotion was that I felt, sometimes in an almost physical sense. (I’m a naturally undemonstrative Englishman, rarely moved by words on a printed page.) Then I realized that, as a Londoner, it was a feeling of overwhelming pride in my poor, brave, battered old city, which stood up to the very worst that Hitler could throw at it for months on end, while still somehow keeping its dignity, cheerfulness, and iron resolve not to surrender.<br><br>I’m a naturally undemonstrative Englishman, yet I had a feeling of overwhelming pride in my poor, brave, battered old city.<br>The Russians invented the excellent idea of dubbing as “hero cities” some of their metropolises, such as Leningrad and Stalingrad, that fought the Germans to the knife in World War II. Paris retained its beauty by deciding not to go down that route in 1940, but instead declared itself an “open city” to the Germans, and so retained the historical architecture and boulevards that we love today in the City of Light.<br><br>Larson expertly describes how, by total contrast, the Heinkel and Dornier bombers flattened whole districts of London, night after terrifying night for months on end, killing tens of thousands of Britons. So London lost much of its ancient built heritage, and there are still ugly scars and gouges on some of our public buildings from that terrible time. For all that Paris is far more gorgeous and elegant, I prefer my hero city.<br><br>Andrew Roberts is the author of Churchill: Walking with Destiny</span>",A Fantastic Read.

Most of what I learned before this book about Churchill and the Blitz came from novels. But here is something I can tell you. I started reading the book out loud to my husband during the Beginning Note to the Reader and I didn’t stop.  There is so much interesting information.

My two regrets are The lack of photos and the lack of any full speeches or radio broadcasts.  Photos would have brought certainly relatively unknown characters to life.  Larson gives us nicely paraphrased summaries and key snippets from major speeches, but at least one full quote would have helped.

In this book, Larson focuses on a pivotal twelve-month period (May 1940 to May 1941); this narrow focus enables him to delve more fully into the idiosyncrasies and human frailties of the principal decision-makers and those around them.  Ironically, by demythologizing Churchill, his family, and his coterie of advisors and confidants, he ends up pointing up their extraordinary courage, persistence, prudence, and pragmatism--virtues which persist despite the fact that these were human beings under immense pressure.<br><br>The fact that this book presents Churchill and others as fully-drawn characters also makes the work compellingly readable--this is most certainly not a dry tome of mere dates, death tolls, or technical minutia.  My only critique of the book is that there occasionally seemed to be too much detail on tertiary and quaternary characters, but in many cases they eventually ended up being tied back into the main narrative thread, so the attention was mostly justified even though the story seems to wander a bit afield at times.<br><br>If readers are looking for a comprehensive history of World War II, or even of England's role in World War II, they will likely be disappointed, but readers seeking a focused window into the personality, thinking and decision-making processes, virtues, and idiosyncrasies of Winston Churchill and those around him will find this an engaging, fascinating, and absorbing read.</span>",Great Read,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAHBVP5LCWNDWU4J73W2YFHF4EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

Also plenty of great stories about his cabinet, closest advisers, friends, and others who were close to the PM during this time.

He loved to hear what other people thought - great trait of leaders, and then make the decisions.

Having read Dead Wake, I looked forward to The Splendid and the Vile.His thorough research and writing style make the reader feel transposed from the couch in the living room to the shelters of London during the German blitz.And holding the British nation together, giving its people hope, was Winston Churchill, he with odd quirks of dress (or undress!), liquor (lots of brandy), derring do (standing on roofs of buildings while bombs fell), but so emotionally invested with the people and their plight, that his tears often flowed. His great speechs, relationship with FDR, dire need for American help, all noted, yet so are the thoughts of his daughter, Mary, who hated the war, worshiped her father, but seemed to have many happy times with parties and dances, his wife Clementine, his confidant and advisor, who always seemed to have a cold, the love life of family and those who worked for him including Averell Harriman, the love he had for his rather poor excuse of a gambling, argumentative, disliked by many son Randolph and the graphic descriptions of death and destruction. Uppermost in my mind on this last is his description of a dog wandering about carrying a child's arm in its mouth. In times of great need, the best seem to come to the fore - the American founding fathers, Abe Lincoln, both Roosevelts, perhaps Gorbachev in Russia, Mandela, Nehru. Meanwhile, the United States is now waiting and wanting for a people loving, nation loving savior to come forth and restore our republic to its once greatness.</span>",Five star book,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEHKWR7SF3ZS3FTHWBOSABKEBMJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8

It's not that the author has revealed new or startling information.  It's not as if we don't know the ending before we start reading.  Larson's contribution to this effort is his ability to give the reader a sense of what it was like to have been in Britain during those beginning months of the War.  We are able to understand how and why the citizenry had the stamina and fortitude to withstand the blitzekrieg, losses of lives, lack of daily sustenances, and thereby confound the enemy.  Let us not consider what might have happened had they been less resilient.</span>",An explanation of British resiliency and stamina,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5NRDPKWNE2Y3TNVUWSZ5KNHJEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8
